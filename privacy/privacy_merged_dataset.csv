Therefore, we introduce the concepts of the sandbox and state channel to construct a new data privacy sharing paradigm via Blockchain and Federated Learning. Under this paradigm, we use state channel to connect Blockchain and Federated Learning. And state channel is used to create a 'trusted sandbox' to instantiate Federated Learning tasks in the trustless edge computing environment. Meanwhile, we also mainly solve problems about data privacy sharing in Federated Learning and system performance degradation caused by data quality.

,"Xu Z., Cao S.",Multi-Source Data Privacy Protection Method Based on Homomorphic Encryption and Blockchain,2023.0,Scopus,,,,,,,10.32604/cmes.2023.025159,,,,,,,,,,,,"Multi-Source data plays an important role in the evolution of media convergence. Its fusion processing enables the further mining of data and utilization of data value and broadens the path for the sharing and dissemination of media data. However, it also faces serious problems in terms of protecting user and data privacy. Many privacy protection methods have been proposed to solve the problem of privacy leakage during the process of data sharing, but they suffer from two flaws: 1) the lack of algorithmic frameworks for specific scenarios such as dynamic datasets in the media domain; 2) the inability to solve the problem of the high computational complexity of ciphertext in multi-source data privacy protection, resulting in long encryption and decryption times. In this paper, we propose a multi-source data privacy protection method based on homomorphic encryption and blockchain technology, which solves the privacy protection problem of multi-source heterogeneous data in the dissemination of media and reduces ciphertext processing time. We deployed the proposed method on the Hyperledger platform for testing and compared it with the privacy protection schemes based on k-anonymity and differential privacy. The experimental results show that the key generation, encryption, and decryption times of the proposed method are lower than those in data privacy protection methods based on k-anonymity technology and differential privacy technology. This significantly reduces the processing time of multi-source data, which gives it potential for use in many applications. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

Data owners set up groups, generating and uploading their data to cloud storage, while other users in the groups download and make use of it, which is called group data sharing. As all kinds of cloud service, data group sharing also suffers from hardware/software failures and human errors. Provable Data Possession (PDP) schemes are proposed to check the integrity of data stored in cloud without downloading. However, there are still some unmet needs lying in auditing group shared data. Researchers propose four issues necessary for a secure group shared data auditing: public verification, identity privacy, collusion attack resistance and traceability. However, none of the published work has succeeded in achieving all of these properties so far. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based ring signature PDP scheme for group shared data, with an instance deployed on a cloud server. We design a linkable ring signature method called Linkable Homomorphic Authenticable Ring Signature (LHARS) to implement public anonymous auditing for group data. We also build smart contracts to resist collusion attack in group auditing.

As locking medical data in a single healthcare center causes information isolation, healthcare centers are motivated to build medical data sharing systems. However, existing systems highly rely on the trusted centralized servers, which are vulnerable to distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks and the single point of failure. Moreover, it is a non-trivial matter to authorize multiple users to search and access EHR in a privacy-preserving manner. In this article, we propose MedShare, a decentralized framework for secure EHR sharing. Our design utilizes the smart contract technique of blockchain to establish a trusted platform for healthcare centers to share their encrypted EHR. Considering that fine-grained access control is essential in practical EHR sharing service, we devise a constant-size attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme, where the access policy is embedded in search result on the blockchain. Besides, we propose an efficient scheme that enables authorized MedShare users to perform multi-keyword boolean search operations over encrypted EHR. We formally analyze the security strengths and implement the system prototype on Ethereum.

For sharing the traffic data with other vehicles, the vehicular sensory data are usually uploaded to the cloud server. However, existing data sharing systems for VANETs cannot provide selective data with sufficient privacy protection. Moreover, some schemes also cannot ensure stable data accessibility and the integrity of retrieved data. On the other hand, with the improvements such as lower latency, higher capacity, and increased bandwidth, 5G technology brings more possibilities to future applications. The join of the software-defined networks (SDNs) also offers efficient and effective network management. This paper proposes a primitive vehicular communication system named blockchain-based privacy-preserving and sustainable data query service. The proposed scheme is designed to realize stable data accessibility by leveraging smart contracts and blockchain oracle. With the help of 5G technology and P2P file-sharing system, InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), the proposed scheme aims to support video downloading files with searchable capability and fairness. An incentive token mechanism is also equipped. The merit of auditability is ensured by Ethereum blockchain platform to support the accountability.

The private data onto specific IoT devices can be combined with intelligent platform to provide help for future research and prediction. As an important digital asset, individuals can sell private data to get rewards. Problems, such as privacy, security, and access control prevent individuals from sharing their private data. The blockchain technology is widely used to build an anonymous trading system. In this article, we construct a blockchain-based privacy-preserving and rewarding private data-sharing scheme (BPRPDS) for IoT. A privacy issue worth considering is that the malicious cloud server may establish a behavior profile database of data users (DUs). In the case of anonymity, the transactions of private data sharing are easy to cause disputes. When anonymous DUs are framed, it is hard to protect their rights. With the help of the deniable ring signature and Monero, we realize the behavior profile building prevention and nonframeability of BPRPDS. At the same time, we utilize the licensing technology executed by smart contracts to ensure flexible access control of multisharing. The proposed BPRPDS is provably secure.

However, provenance graphs have the graph structure containing sensitive information including the records as well as the linkages between the records. Both need to be kept secret from the unauthorized users including the blockchain peers. Storing the record linkages on blockchain in a privacy-preserving manner is challenging because (1) past records cannot be modified due to the tamper-proofness, (2) efficient graph tracking/tracing on blockchain is necessary for a provenance system on blockchain, and (3) the size of the records' pointer may leak the volume of linkages. Existing approaches either fail to provide linkage privacy protection to the provenance graph, could only support less-complicated structure such as tree, or leak the volume of linkages from the block sizes. We present Trac2Chain, a framework that provides complete linkage privacy as well as full tracking/tracing functions for the provenance graphs stored on blockchain. The novel graph storage design in Trac2Chain allows generation of the provenance dependencies of arbitrary graph structure while still enjoying the tamper-proofness of blockchain.

Such raw data needs to be stored and accessed from a non-proprietary database while the obfuscation and encryption techniques on current cloud-based proprietary solutions incur data losses that are deemed inefficient for accurate usage, particularly in time-sensitive real-time operations. In this paper, we target the problem of scalably storing and retrieving potentially sensitive data generated by vehicles and propose TREAD, a blockchain-based system comprising smart contracts to store this mobility data on a distributed ledger such that multiple peers can access and utilize it in different location-based applications while not revealing users’ sensitive personal information. It is, however, challenging to scalably store large amounts of constantly generated trajectories, and to achieve scalability we leverage InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a scalable distributed peer-to-peer data storage system. To avoid users injecting malicious/fake trajectories into the ledger, we develop efficient consensus algorithms for the stakeholders to validate the storage and retrieval process in a distributed manner.

To solve these problems, this paper proposes a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain-based secure data transfer scheme for enterprises in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT). We store raw data in the IIoT in the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) network after encryption and store the Keyword-index table we designed in Hyperledger Fabric blockchain, and enterprises share the data by querying the Keyword-index table. We use Fabric’s channel mechanism combined with our designed Chaincode to achieve privacy protection and efficient data transmission while using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) to ensure data integrity. Finally, we performed security analysis and experiments on the proposed scheme, and the results show that overall the data transfer performance in the IPFS network is generally better than the traditional network, In the case of transferring 5 MB file size data, the transmission speed and latency of IPFS are 19.23 mb/s and 0.26 s, respectively, and the IPFS network is almost 4 times faster than the TCP/IP network while taking only a quarter of the time, which is more advantageous when transferring small files, such as data in the IIOT. In addition, our scheme outperforms the blockchain systems mainly used today in terms of both throughput, latency, and system overhead. The average throughput of our solution can reach 110 tps (transactions are executed per second), and the minimum throughput in experimental tests can reach 101 tps. © 2022 by the authors.",,,Sensors,8.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123872454&doi=10.3390%2fs22031146&partnerID=40&md5=5b35034e37f378407bb45e95ab532dde,Chaincode; Data security sharing; Hyperledger Fabric blockchain; Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT); IPFS; Privacy-preserved,Cryptography; Data privacy; Data transfer; Digital storage; Distributed ledger; Electronic document identification systems; Internet of things; Block-chain; Chain codes; Data security sharing; Data Sharing; Filesystem; Hyperledg fabric blockchain; Industrial internet of thing; Inter-planetary file system; Privacy-preserved; Systems networks; Blockchain; article; blockchain; cloud computing; data integrity; encryption; experimental test; information security; internet of things; privacy; theft; velocity,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",2-s2.0-85123872454

This paper introduces a blockchain-based data acquisition scheme during the pandemic in which federated learning (FL) is employed to assemble privacy-sensitive data as a form of the trained model instead of raw data.

With the addition of smart contracts, blockchains can track and verify arbitrary computations - which enables blockchain users to verify the provenance of information derived from data through the blockchain. This provenance comes at the cost of data confidentiality and user privacy, however, which is unacceptable for many sensitive applications. The need for verifiable yet confidential data sharing and computation has led some to add trusted execution environment (TEE) hardware to blockchain platforms. By moving sensitive operations (e.g., data decryption and analysis) off of the blockchain and into a TEE, they get both the confidentiality of TEEs and the transparency of blockchains without the need to completely trust any one party in the data-sharing ecosystem.In this paper, we build on our TEE-enabled blockchain data-sharing system, Amanuensis, to ensure the freshness of access-control lists shared between the blockchain and TEE, and to improve the privacy of users interacting within the system. We also detail how TEE-based remote attestation help us to achieve information provenance - specifically, how to achieve information provenance in the context of the Intel SGX trusted execution environment. Finally, we present an evaluation of our system, in which we test several real-world machine-learning applications (logistic regression, kNN, SVM) to determine the run-time overhead of information confidentiality and provenance.

However, despite increased attention to the security of electronic health records, patient privacy is still at risk for data breaches. Thus, it is quite a challenge to involve an access control system especially if the patient's medical data are accessible by users who have diverse privileges in different situations. Blockchain is a new technology that can be adopted for decentralized access control management issues. Nevertheless, different scalability, security, and privacy challenges affect this technology. To address these issues, we suggest a novel Decentralized Self-Management of data Access Control (DSMAC) system using a blockchain-based Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) model for privacy-preserving medical data, empowering patients with mechanisms to preserve control over their personal information and allowing them to self-grant access rights to their medical data. DSMAC leverages smart contracts to conduct Role-based Access Control policies and adopts the implementation of decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials to describe advanced access control techniques for emergency cases.

Maintaining the value stability of RMB payment means and the security and efficiency of RMB settlement system are the key measures to promote the internationalization of RMB. Aiming at the problem of data insecurity and untrustworthiness in traditional information systems, this paper proposes a data protection technology for information systems based on blockchain. In the hierarchical authority information system, multichain structure is adopted to divide the authority of nodes in each layer, so that only the nodes with corresponding authority can access and operate data. Private digital currency, which is based on blockchain technology and represented by payment token and stable currency, helps to improve the defects of the agent banking model but increases additional market risks and trust risks.

The procedure of exchanging medical information is increasingly concerned with data privacy. Many techniques have been offered for preserving data security. These techniques use approaches such as (Formula presented.) -anonymity, (Formula presented.) -diversity, and others. However, such solutions are vulnerable to attribute disclosure, homogeneity, and background knowledge risks due to their syntactic nature. In this work, we describe a safe and secure architecture and semantic approach for data sharing that is based on blockchain, local differential privacy (LDP), and federated learning (FL). The proposed framework generates an atmosphere devoid of trust in which data owners are no longer required to have trust in the controllers. The FL models enable the whole network to decentralize its data-driven learning. Interplanetary file system (IPFS) is used to provide data security in a distributed environment because each file in IPFS has a digital fingerprint that is computed using a cryptographic hash function on the file's whole contents. Due to the rigorous privacy guarantee, data owners no longer need to be worried about the security of their data. The proposed model's assessment parameters include latency, throughput, privacy, and accuracy. The data privacy of the proposed model is protected via LDP and FL, and its latency and throughput communication transactions on permissioned blockchain are calculated and compared with those of the benchmark model. The findings indicate that the proposed model delivers 85% more accurate privacy than the benchmark model. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,Expert Systems,2.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136894604&doi=10.1111%2fexsy.13131&partnerID=40&md5=c9f3dc086ac032813fa6da0a5893041c,blockchain; federated learning; local differential privacy; privacy protection,Hash functions; Hospital data processing; Learning systems; Peer to peer networks; Privacy-preserving techniques; Semantics; Background knowledge; Benchmark models; Block-chain; Differential privacies; Federated learning; Filesystem; Local differential privacy; Medical information; Patient data; Privacy protection; Blockchain,Article,Article in Press,,2-s2.0-85136894604

Unfortunately, current personal data privacy protection schemes still suffer from explicit storage, lack of data ownership and implementation of fine-grained access control by users, and lack of transparency and auditability of data. In this article, we propose a personal data privacy protection scheme based on consortium blockchain that stores original data encrypted with an improved Paillier homomorphic encryption mechanism, namely PDPChain, where users realize fine-grained access control based on ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) on blockchain. In this scheme, consortium blockchain combines distributed private clusters to store the encrypted data, improving data transmission efficiency, and guaranteeing user privacy and security through off-chain storage and on-chain transmission synergy. In addition, it is more lightweight encryption and demarcation, ultimately protecting personal data privacy and providing a secure and trusted way to obtain information for data mining. For the performance testing, data in the form of files are used as an example, and the scheme is designed and simulated on Hyperledger Fabric and InterPlanetary File System. Experimental results show that the improved Paillier encryption mechanism reduces the overall encryption and decryption elapsed time by 25&#x0025; and encryption elapsed time by 48&#x0025;. Furthermore, the proposed CP-ABE access control method is adaptive to storing and sharing a massive amount of data. With the increase in the number of access control policies, the overall time-consuming of the scheme does not increase, and the time-consuming of decryption can also be stabilized at about 2&#x00A0;s.

Focusing on the issues of medical data sharing and privacy protection, we propose a medical data sharing scheme based on consortium blockchain. To achieve access control, attribute-based access control technique is implemented, where patients preset attribute-specific access policies for their medical records, and record requesters are described by a set of attributes. For patients, we devise a hybrid storage mode to write access policies of medical records on the consortium blockchain network and store encrypted medical records off-chain. Leveraging blockchain and smart contracts, access privilege control and access history tracking can be realized. To enhance the key management, a tree of medical records is constructed for each patient, and by simply keeping the medical record trees, patients can recover their encryption keys at any time.

Health data are usually collected from edge-based Internet of medical things (IoMT) with devices such as smart wearable devices, smart watches, and smartphones. Since health data are highly private and have great financial value, adversaries ceaselessly launch diverse attacks to obtain private information. All these issues pose great challenges to health data sharing in edge-based IoMT scenarios. Existing research either lacks comprehensive consideration of privacy and security protection or fails to provide a proper incentive mechanism, which expels users from sharing data. In this study, we propose a novel blockchain-assisted data sharing scheme, which allows secure and privacy-preserving profile matching.

Key-policy attribute-based encryption (KP-ABE) algorithm and smart contracts are employed to achieve secure profile matching.

The optimal pricing mechanism is specially designed for encouraging more users to participate in health data sharing and maximizing users’ profit. Moreover, security analysis illustrates that the proposed protocol is capable of satisfying various security goals, while performance evaluation shows high scalability and feasibility of the proposed scheme in edge-based IoMT scenarios.

However, if data is stored, supervised, and distributed on a multiparty equal blockchain, it will face major security risks, such as data privacy leakage, unauthorized access, and trust issues.

We propose a secure and trusted agricultural product traceability system (BCST-APTS), which is supported by blockchain and CP-ABE encryption technology. It can set access control policies through data attributes and encrypt data on the blockchain. This can not only ensure the confidentiality of the data stored in the blockchain, but also set flexible access control policies for the data. In addition, a whole-chain attribute management infrastructure has been constructed, which can provide personalized attribute encryption services. Furthermore, a reencryption scheme based on ciphertext-policy attribute encryption (RE-CP-ABE) is proposed, which can meet the needs of efficient supervision and sharing of ciphertext data.

However, the existing data sharing and querying mechanism in Hyperledger fabric is not suitable for supply chain environment in IIoT because the queries are evaluated on actual data stored on ledger which consists of sensitive information such as business secrets, and special discounts offered to retailers and individuals. To solve this problem, we propose a differential privacy-based permissioned blockchain using Hyperledger fabric to enable private data sharing in supply chain in IIoT (DH-IIoT). We integrate differential privacy into the chaindcode (smart contract) of Hyperledger fabric to achieve privacy preservation. As a result, the query response consists of perturbed data which protects the sensitive information in the ledger. We evaluate and compare our differential privacy integrated chaincode of Hyperledger fabric with the default chaincode setting of Hyperledger fabric for supply chain scenario.

In the battle against the outbreak of COVID-19, how to manage and share the COVID-19 Electric Medical Records (CEMRs) safely and effectively in the world, prevent malicious users from tampering with CEMRs, and protect the privacy of patients are very worthy of attention. In particular, the semi-trusted medical cloud platform has become the primary means of hospital medical data management and information services. Security and privacy issues in the medical cloud platform are more prominent and should be addressed with priority. To address these issues, on the basis of ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption, we propose a blockchain-empowered security and privacy protection scheme with traceable and direct revocation for COVID-19 medical records. In this scheme, we perform the blockchain for uniform identity authentication and all public keys, revocation lists, etc are stored on a blockchain. The system manager server is responsible for generating the system parameters and publishes the private keys for the COVID-19 medical practitioners and users. The cloud service provider (CSP) stores the CEMRs and generates the intermediate decryption parameters using policy matching. The user can calculate the decryption key if the user has private keys and intermediate decrypt parameters. Only when attributes are satisfied access policy and the user's identity is out of the revocation list, the user can get the intermediate parameters by CSP. The malicious users may track according to the tracking list and can be directly revoked. The security analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme is indicated to be safe under the Decision Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) assumption and can resist many attacks. The simulation experiment demonstrates that the communication and storage overhead is less than other schemes in the public-private key generation, CEMRs encryption, and decryption stages. Besides, we also verify that the proposed scheme works well in the blockchain in terms of both throughput and delay. © 2013 IEEE.",,,IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering,80.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112670673&doi=10.1109%2fTNSE.2021.3101842&partnerID=40&md5=c6f3eb1189145441e1c3032d92787dec,Blockchain; COVID-19; electronic medical records.; security and privacy protection; traceable and revocation,Blockchain; Cryptography; Digital storage; Information management; Information services; Privacy by design; Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryptions; Global public health; Medical data management; Privacy preserving; Security analysis; Security and privacy issues; Security and privacy protection; Storage overhead; Data Sharing,Article,Final,,2-s2.0-85112670673

Security is considered an important issue in the design of IoT networks in the healthcare environment. To resolve this issue, this article presents a novel blockchain and artificial intelligence-enabled secure medical data transmission (BAISMDT) for IoT networks. The goal of the BAISMDT model is to achieve security and privacy in reliable data transmission of the IoT networks. The proposed model involves a signcryption technique for secure and reliable IoT data transmission. The blockchain-enabled secure medical data transmission process takes place among the IoT gadgets and service providers. The blockchain technique is applied to generate a viable environment to securely and reliably transmit data among different data providers. Next to the decryption process, the modified discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm with wavelet kernel extreme learning machine model is applied to determine the presence of disease.

Due to recent laws and regulations (e.g, General Data Protection Regulation), PPRL approaches are increasingly demanded in real-world application areas such as health-care, credit analysis, public policy evaluation, and national security. However, the majority of the PPRL approaches consider an unrealistic adversary model, particularly the Honest but Curious (HBC) model, which assumes that all PPRL parties will follow a pre-agreed data integration protocol, and will not try to break the confidentiality of the data handled during the process. The HBC model is hard to employ in real-world applications, mainly because of the need to trust other parties fully. To overcome the limitations associated with the majority of the adversary models considered by PPRL approaches, we propose a protocol that considers covert adversaries, i.e., adversaries that may deviate arbitrarily from the protocol specification in an attempt to cheat. In such protocol, however, the honest parties are able to detect this misbehavior with a high probability. To provide a proof-of-concept implementation of this protocol, we employ the Blockchain technology and propose an improvement in the most used anonymization technique for PPRL, the Bloom Filter.

A large number of sensors and machinery are connected, and combined with the Internet, to achieve intelligent management and operation. However, the traditional centralized IoT data management solution inevitably encounters challenges of data trust, security, sustainability, and user privacy is difficult to guarantee. This paper takes the intelligent transportation sensor network as an example and proposes a blockchain-based Internet of Vehicles (IoV) data secure sharing scheme (called IoVChain), which implements automatic registration, rapid authentication, and reliable sharing method of IoV data through smart contract. The smart contract performs homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proof processing on the sensitive part of the data, and this part exists in the form of ciphertext on the blockchain. We adopt PBFT consensus mechanism to ensure the consistency of the entire network ledger, and all the IoV data processing and usage procedure is stored in the Merkle-tree-based block, which cannot be tampered with. Compared with the centralized IoV data management solution, the IoVChain scheme avoids the risk of single point of failure, and keeps the IoV data credible, available, and tamper-resistant under the premise of privacy and security, so that the data can be traced when needed. We have implemented the IoVChain scheme based on the consortium blockchain for trusted and secure sharing of IoV data.

Cloud computing is unreliable, using it can compromise user privacy, and data may be leaked. Because cloud‐data and grid infrastructure are both growing exponentially, there is an urgent need to explore computational sources and cloud large‐data protection. Numerous cloud service categories are assimilated into numerous fields, such as defense systems and pharmaceutical databases, to compute information space and allocation of resources. Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) is a sophisticated approach which can permit employees to specify a higher level of security for data stored in cloud storage facilities. Numerous obsolete ABE techniques are practical when applied to small data sets to generate cryptograms with restricted computational properties; their properties are used to generate the key, encrypt it, and decrypt it. To address the current concerns, a dynamic non‐linear polynomial chaotic quantum hash technique on top of secure block chain model can be used for enhancing cloud data security while maintaining user privacy. In the proposed method, customer attributes are guaranteed by using a dynamic non‐ polynomial chaotic map function for the key initialization, encryption, and decryption. In the proposed model, both organized and unorganized massive clinical data are considered to be inputs for reliable corroboration and encoding.

,"Kong Q., Su L., Ma M.",Achieving Privacy-Preserving and Verifiable Data Sharing in Vehicular Fog with Blockchain,2021.0,Scopus,,,,,,,10.1109/TITS.2020.2983466,,,,,,,,,,,,"Vehicular sensing is advocated to perform data collection by exploiting a plethora of vehicular on-board sensors; meanwhile, with the merging of vehicular sensing and fog computing, the deployed road side units (RSUs) can act as fog nodes to collect and share vehicular sensory data at the network edge. However, there are still several problems in terms of the secure and reliable sharing of sensory data in vehicular fog. To resolve these issues, in this paper, we present an efficient, privacy-preserving and verifiable sensory data collection and sharing scheme with a permissioned blockchain in vehicular fog. During the data collection phase, by combining the homomorphic 2-DNF (Disjunctive Normal Form) cryptosystem and an identity-based signcryption scheme, our proposed scheme achieves the secure and verifiable computation of the average and variance of the collected vehicular sensory data. Meanwhile, to achieve efficient and reliable data sharing, we exploit a permissioned blockchain to maintain an immutable and tamper-proof record of the derived sensory data. Security analysis demonstrates the security properties of the proposed scheme, in terms of location privacy preservation, verifiability and immutability.

Current existing data analysis solutions, however, assume that the data are reliably and securely collected from different IIoT data providers, an assumption that is not always true in the real world. To address the issues, in this article we propose a privacy-preserving tucker train decomposition based on gradient descent over blockchain-based encrypted IIoT data. Specifically, we use blockchain techniques to enable IIoT data providers to reliably and securely share their data by encrypting them locally before recording them in the blockchain. We use tensor train (TT) theory to build an efficient TT-based tucker decomposition based on gradient descent that tremendously reduces the number of elements to be updated during the tucker decomposition. We utilize the massive resources of fogs and clouds to implement an efficient privacy-preserving tucker train decomposition scheme.

Data aggregation is one of the key technologies in wireless sensor networks, which reduces the amount of data transmission between nodes by merging similar data and simplifying redundant data, thus significantly reducing the computation cost and communication overhead of the system. Many data aggregation schemes have been developed for the smart grid in the past years. However, most of the data aggregation schemes ignore the data security and privacy protection issues of the edge layer. To solve these problems, in this article, we propose an edge blockchain assisted lightweight privacy-preserving data aggregation for smart grid, named EBDA. In this work, we integrate edge computing and blockchain to design a three-layer architecture data aggregation scheme for smart grid. This new architecture supports a two-level data aggregation scheme, which is more efficient and secure.

In this environment, surrounded by technologies, data, and personal information, have become an essential and coveted tool for many sectors. In this scenario, where a large amount of data has been collected, stored, and shared, privacy concerns arise, especially when dealing with sensitive data such as health data. The information owner generally has no control over his information, which can bring serious consequences such as increases in health insurance prices or put the individual in an uncomfortable situation with disclosing his physical or mental health. While privacy regulations, like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), make it clear that the information owner must have full control and management over their data, disparities have been observed in most systems and platforms. Therefore, they are often not able to give consent or have control and management over their data. For the users to exercise their right to privacy and have sufficient control over their data, they must know everything that happens to them, where their data is, and where they have been. It is necessary that the entire life cycle, from generation to deletion of data, is managed by its owner. To this end, this article presents an Information Chain of Custody Model based on Blockchain technology, which allows from the traceability of information to the offer of tools that will enable the effective management of data, offering total control to its owner.

Collection of fine-grained energy usage data by these smart meters provides numerous advantages such as energy savings for customers with use of demand optimization, a billing system of higher accuracy with dynamic pricing programs, bidirectional information exchange ability between end-users for better consumer-operator interaction, and so on. However, all these perks associated with fine-grained energy usage data collection threaten the privacy of users. With this technology, customers' personal data such as sleeping cycle, number of occupants, and even type and number of appliances stream into the hands of the utility companies and can be subject to misuse. This research paper addresses privacy violation of consumers' energy usage data collected from smart meters and provides a novel solution for the privacy protection while allowing benefits of energy data analytics. First, we demonstrate the successful application of occupancy detection attacks using a deep neural network method that yields high accuracy results.

Sharing health data is considered a key way to improve the quality of health care services and reduce the cost of health care. However, nowadays, many people will create electronic health records in different hospitals. In the process of cross-hospital diagnosis, due to the decentralized storage of electronic medical record in various hospitals, the electronic health records cannot be shared. This phenomenon will cause obstacles to doctors' diagnosis, impede data sharing and endanger patient privacy. To solve these problems, we propose an EHRs privacy protection data sharing scheme based on blockchain. In this scheme, the original EHRs are securely stored in the cloud. The generated index is stored on the hospital private blockchain. Visitors can obtain the index of electronic health records through the blockchain. It's convenient to view the patient's electronical health records and diagnose the patient's condition in detail. In this way, the risk of medical data leakage can be greatly reduced. The advantages in the blockchain ensure that EHRs cannot be arbitrarily modified. Meanwhile, the original data is stored in the cloud, while the blockchain only stores indexes, which solves the problem of limited storage space in the blockchain. According to the current medical situation, we put forward Wanchain as a service (WaaS), and propose a cross-blockchain based privacy-preserving data sharing for electronic health records. Wanchain is used to achieve cross-blockchain secure access to EHRs data when patients visit different hospitals.

However, ensuring security and privacy in the IoT data aggregation process is a non-trivial task. Generally, the IoT data aggregation process is based on centralized servers. Yet, in the case of distributed approaches, it is difficult to coordinate several untrustworthy parties. Fortunately, the blockchain may provide decentralization while overcoming the trust problem. Consequently, blockchain-based IoT data aggregation may become a reasonable choice for the design of a privacy-preserving system. To this end, we propose PrivDA, a Privacy-preserving IoT Data Aggregation scheme based on the blockchain and homomorphic encryption technologies. In the proposed system, each data consumer can create a smart contract and publish both terms of service and requested IoT data. Thus, the smart contract puts together into one group potential data producers that can answer the consumer’s request and chooses one aggregator, the role of which is to compute the group requested result using homomorphic computations. Therefore, group-level aggregation obfuscates IoT data, which complicates sensitive information inference from a single IoT device.

K-anonymity is one of the most popular privacy protection solutions, in which the real location of the request vehicle (RV) can be covered by a cloaking area including the location of k-1 cooperative vehicles (CVs). However, K-anonymity assumes all CVs are always honest and thus offering opportunities for dishonest CVs to provide false location information. To combat such threats, we propose a trusted cloaking area construction (TCAC) scheme based on the trust mechanism to protect the location privacy of vehicles. In this article, the trust value is not only used to identify dishonest CVs, but also utilized to decide the LBS request of RV. A low trust value will make the LBS request be rejected due to dishonest and selfish cooperative behaviors when the RV has played the role of CV. To deal with the massive trust requirements caused by frequent vehicle movement, edge computing is employed to assist trust value evaluation. Moreover, traditional central and distributed trust data management may be unsuitable for vehicular networks.

However, ensuring security and privacy in the IoT context is a non-trivial task due to the low capability of these connected devices. Generally, the IoT device management is based on a centralized entity that validates communication and connection rights. Therefore, this centralized entity can be considered as a single point of failure. Yet, in the case of distributed approaches, it is difficult to delegate the right validation to IoT devices themselves in untrustworthy IoT environments. Fortunately, the blockchain may provide decentralization of overcoming the trust problem while designing a privacy-preserving system. To this end, we propose a novel privacy-preserving IoT device management framework based on the blockchain technology. In the proposed system, the IoT devices are controlled by several smart contracts that validate the connection rights according to the privacy permission settings predefined by the data owners and the stored record array of detected misbehavior of each IoT device. In fact, smart contracts can immediately detect the devices that have vulnerabilities and have been hacked or pose a threat to the IoT network. Therefore, the data owner's privacy is preserved by enforcing the control over the own devices. For validation purposes, we deploy the proposed solution on a private Ethereum blockchain and give the performance evaluation. © 2021 ACM.",,,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,12.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101664692&doi=10.1145%2f3434776&partnerID=40&md5=e7e63f5f611fd33372f6f04a22bf65ea,Behavior control; blockchain; Internet of Things; smart contract,Blockchain; Privacy by design; Behavior control; Device management; Distributed approaches; Internet of thing (IOT); Non-trivial tasks; Privacy preserving; Quality of life; Security and privacy; Internet of things,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",2-s2.0-85101664692

Therefore, we propose a supervisable energy transaction data privacy protection scheme, which aims to trade off the supervision of energy transaction data by the supervisory authority and the privacy protection of transaction data. First, the concealment of the transaction amount is realized by Pedersen commitment and Bulletproof range proof. Next, the combination of ElGamal encryption and zero-knowledge proof technology ensures the authenticity of audit tickets, which allows regulators to achieve reliable supervision of the transaction privacy data without opening the commitment.

This process produces delay and possibility in request rejection due to update conflict. In addition, data removal is no longer feasible since each record is protected by immutable hashed link.

However, the poor implementation of access control of educational data produced by the IoT devices has brought students' and teachers' privacy into danger. Attackers can access educational data that they are not permitted to access and even erase the records during access. To tackle this problem, we employ blockchain technology to guarantee the integrity of access control rules and trace the records of access events. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based access control scheme for the data produced by IoT devices. The scheme consists of three components: (1) a well-implemented data collection module that is deployed in smart classrooms, which collects and uploads data about the real-time situation inside the smart classroom to the data center; (2) a MongoDB-based data center and its control module that makes access control decisions based on the verification of the permissions of visitors, where the permissions are managed by blockchain; and (3) a customized blockchain system that stores and keeps security policy updates of the role-based access control module and records access events in a trusted way. Our analysis indicates that the proposed access control scheme guarantees the correctness of the access control process and makes the access of collected educational data auditable and responsible. Our system collectively analyzes the context of the smart classroom and is capable of detecting multiple scenarios such as absence, lateness, and gunshot. We show how the scheme preserves students' and teachers' privacy by carrying out extensive experimental studies.

Meanwhile, the health-related mobile apps and devices also generate a large amount of medical data, which is critical for promoting disease research and diagnosis. However, medical data is too sensitive to share, which is also a common issue for IoT (Internet of Things) data. The traditional centralized cloud-based medical data sharing schemes have to rely on a single trusted third party. Therefore, the schemes suffer from single-point failure and lack of privacy protection and access control for the data. Blockchain is an emerging technique to provide an approach for managing data in a decentralized manner. Especially, the blockchain-based smart contract technique enables the programmability for participants to access the data. All the interactions are authenticated and recorded by the other participants of the blockchain network, which is tamper resistant. In this paper, we leverage the K-anonymity and searchable encryption techniques and propose a blockchain-based privacy-preserving scheme for medical data sharing among medical institutions and data users. To be specific, the consortium blockchain, Hyperledger Fabric, is adopted to allow data users to search for encrypted medical data records. The smart contract, i.e., the chaincode, implements the attribute-based access control mechanisms to guarantee that the data can only be accessed by the user with proper attributes. The K-anonymity and searchable encryption ensure that the medical data is shared without privacy leaking, i.e., figuring out an individual patient from queries. We implement a prototype system using the chaincode of Hyperledger Fabric. From the functional perspective, security analysis shows that the proposed scheme satisfies security goals and precedes others.

Compared with previous works, DSS-PP has obvious advantages in several important aspects: (1) In the process of identity authentication, it protects users' personal information by using authentication technology with hidden attributes; (2) the encrypted shared resources are stored in off-chain database of the blockchain, while only the ciphertext index information is stored in the block. It reduces the storage load of the blockchain; (3) it uses blockchain logging technology to trace and account for illegal access. Under the hardness assumption of Inverse Computational Diffe–Hellman (ICDH) problem, this model is proven to be correct and safe.

Most of the existing solutions assume that the classifier’s training data can be obtained securely from different IoT data providers. The primary concern is data privacy when training a K-Nearest Neighbour (K-NN) classifier with IoT data from various entities. This paper proposes secure K-NN, which provides a privacy-preserving K-NN training over IoT data. It employs Blockchain technology with a partial homomorphic cryptosystem (PHC) known as Paillier in order to protect all participants (i.e., IoT data analyst C and IoT data provider P) data privacy. When C analyzes the IoT data of P, both participants’ privacy issue arises and requires a trusted third party. To protect each candidate’s privacy and remove the dependency on a third-party, we assemble secure building blocks in secure K-NN based on Blockchain technology. Firstly, a protected data-sharing platform is developed among various P, where encrypted IoT data is registered on a shared ledger. Secondly, the secure polynomial operation (SPO), secure biasing operations (SBO), and secure comparison (SC) are designed using the homomorphic property of Paillier. It shows that secure K-NN does not need any trusted third-party at the time of interaction, and rigorous security analysis demonstrates that secure K-NN protects sensitive data privacy for each P and C. The secure K-NN achieved 97.84%, 82.33%, and 76.33% precisions on BCWD, HDD, and DD datasets. The performance of secure K-NN is precisely similar to the general K-NN and outperforms all the previous state of art methods. © 2020 by the authors.

Individuals can transact in an anonymous but transparent manner. Their identities remain hidden but the records of their transactions are publicly available. This has had its benefits in certain application areas but might not be suited for transactions where it is important to know who you are dealing with and in circumstances where the data in the blockchain might be confidential. Private blockchain networks are better suited for such transactions as only authorized users can transact on the network. Sensitive data can also be stored on the blockchain as it is possible to restrict the users that can see the details of the transactions. This paper describes how to create a private blockchain network and how other users can join the network.

In 2016, a large-scale DDoS attack, named Dyn, caused massive damage to several well-known companies. One effective countermeasure is observing previous network traffic information or abnormal behavior determined by the host machines and determining the latest DDoS-attack IP addresses. Because of the lack of a fair exchange mechanism, most security operation centers (SOCs) are unwilling to share their real-time DDoS data. In this article, we propose a decentralized DDoS data exchange platform, namely SOChain, using blockchain technology to overcome the trust and fairness issues. The platform incentivizes SOCs through the DDoS_coin token. The more DDoS information an SOC contributes, the more coins it earns. To confirm the validity of uploaded information, we enlist a content verifier to examine uploaded abnormal IP addresses. Moreover, the verifier is incentivized by the DDoS_coin. To decrease the management effort, the entire flow is automatically executed in smart contract deployed onto the blockchain system.

Despite the advantages, users must rely on storage services for data confidentiality, data access control, user privacy, and data availability. Whereas data confidentiality can be protected by advanced encryption algorithms, the rest remain challenging. First, in existing centralized storage services, even though data access controls are mainly defined by data owners, they are maintained and enforced by the services, which can deny data retrieval requests of authorized users or allow requests of illegitimate users. Second, the identity of a user is often known to the services to verify its eligibility to access requested data according to the access control, thus making the user traceable in the system. More importantly, the lack of anonymity may make users reluctant to use such services in sensitive contexts. Third, a huge amount of data is daily generated and stored on a centralized party, simultaneously serving requests from many users, which may cause a collapse of the system during peak periods.

In business-driven CPS, end users are required to share their personal information with multiple third parties. To prevent data leakage and preserve user privacy, the authors isolate and feed different information retrieval requests using tokens specifically generated for each type of request. Providing both traceability of data operations, and unlinkability of end user activities, a robust blockchain-based CPS is prototyped. Evaluation indicates the architecture is capable of assured data provenance validation and user privacy preservation at a low overhead. © 2020 by IGI Global.

Besides, the blockchain can be described in a decentralized manner as an immutable ledger for recording data entries. Furthermore, this new technology has been developed to interrupt a variety of data-driven fields, including the health sector. However, blockchain refers to the distributed ledger technology, which constitutes an innovation in the information recording and sharing without a trusted third party. In this paper, blockchain and Distributed Ledger-based Improved Biomedical Security system (BDL-IBS) has been proposed to enhance the privacy and data security across healthcare applications. Further, our goal is to make it possible for patients to use the data to support their care and to provide strong consent systems for sharing data among di_erent organizations and applications, since this includes managing and accessing a high amount of medical information, and this technology can maintain data to ensure reliability. Finally, results show that new blockchain-based digital platforms allow for fast, easy, and seamless interactions between data suppliers to enhance privacy and data security, including for patients themselves. © 2020 by the authors.

The traditional centralized processing method adopts centralized transmission and storage of users’ data privacy, which improves the security and reliability of processing. The non central blockchain technology uses distributed ledger technology to realize the characteristics of disintermediation, data tampering, traceability, work audit, etc. encryption algorithm is used to encrypt the data, and consensus mechanism makes the data sharing of blockchain system more fair and stable. The current passive data privacy schemes are basically based on cryptography. On the premise of satisfying the constraint mechanism of blockchain, this paper studies the technical framework, encryption mechanism and empirical analysis of blockchain, and discusses the information privacy protection method of hiding the original big data as much as possible, so as to improve the system performance and protect the security and privacy of user data.

However, electronic medical data are stored in isolated data silos within each hospital due to the privacy and competition. Because of the complex interests of various groups, there is a lack of data flow between medical entities. On the one hand, this leads to difficulties for patients to obtain their own electronic medical data and to referral between different hospitals. On the other hand, it has led to serious lack of actual data for medical researchers. The realization of the determination of medical data ownership is the first condition for realizing medical data circulation. How to retrieve the required medical data while protecting privacy is the second problem to be solved. In this paper, we design the medical metadata as the smallest subunit of data ownership confirmation and propose a blockchain-based medical data sharing Framework MDSF, which can be used for electronic medical data ownership confirmation and data search while protecting patient privacy. We use the petri nets to verify the system and prove its reachability and boundedness, which means it can realize its designed function and operate safely. The system provides users with a convenient and safe way to obtain their past medical data, also enables research institutions engaged in medical data mining to easily search and obtain the actual medical data needed after desensitization.

As a typical ML model, support vector machine (SVM) enables efficient data classification and thereby finds its applications in real-world scenarios, such as disease diagnosis and anomaly detection. Training an SVM classifier usually requires a collection of labeled IoT data from multiple entities, raising great concerns about data privacy. Most of the existing solutions rely on an implicit assumption that the training data can be reliably collected from multiple data providers, which is often not the case in reality. To bridge the gap between ideal assumptions and realistic constraints, in this paper, we propose secureSVM, which is a privacy-preserving SVM training scheme over blockchain-based encrypted IoT data. We utilize the blockchain techniques to build a secure and reliable data sharing platform among multiple data providers, where IoT data is encrypted and then recorded on a distributed ledger. We design secure building blocks, such as secure polynomial multiplication and secure comparison, by employing a homomorphic cryptosystem, Paillier, and construct a secure SVM training algorithm, which requires only two interactions in a single iteration, with no need for a trusted third-party. Rigorous security analysis prove that the proposed scheme ensures the confidentiality of the sensitive data for each data provider as well as the SVM model parameters for data analysts.

Medical data is gradually becoming more and more important, while it also faces some challenges, among which the most urgent problem to be solved is data security and privacy protection. In the construction of intelligent hospitals, the safety issues among the basic information of patients, the protection of medical information and inter-institutional information sharing have become the focus at this stage. Blockchain technology, with highly security, reliable architecture and algorithm design have operated stably in the financial industry for more than seven years. The related innovative technologies such as distributed ledgers, smart contracts, symmetric encryptions and consensus mechanisms are used widely in many fields. This paper will take the demonstration construction of Chongqing Intelligent Hospital as an example, which tries to combine the blockchain, homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proof technology to carry out the research on the security construction and data privacy protection of intelligent hospitals. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Journal of Physics: Conference Series,4.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067659748&doi=10.1088%2f1742-6596%2f1187%2f5%2f052064&partnerID=40&md5=aae846aeca45f5a25b244b8bec55fe60,,Bioinformatics; Blockchain; Cryptography; Data mining; Hospitals; Information services; Power control; Power electronics; Data privacy protections; Data security and privacy; Ho-momorphic encryptions; Information sharing; Innovative technology; Medical information; Symmetric encryption; Zero knowledge proof; Data privacy,Conference Paper,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze",2-s2.0-85067659748

Most existing solutions mainly focus on an honest-but-curious cloud server, while security designs against a malicious server have not drawn enough attention. Although there are a few works addressing the issue of verifiable designs that enable the data owner to verify the integrity of search results. Unfortunately, these verification schemes are not efficient and or applicable from one scenario to another. Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose a publicly verifiable search framework for outsourced encrypted data based on blockchain. In our framework, we store the encrypted index in a decentralized blockchain (Ethereum) while outsourcing the corresponding encrypted data to the cloud or Interplanetary File System (IPFS). Thus, once a user is authorized, he/she can get the query results and check the query integrity efficiently by the designed smart contract anytime without data owner being online. Besides, to guarantee the privacy of the data user in the Ethereum, we construct a stealth authorization scheme to achieve access authorization delivery. The security analysis and performance evaluation show that the proposed scheme is secure and practical for verification of encrypted data. © 2019 IEEE.",,,IEEE International Conference on Communications,17.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070237152&doi=10.1109%2fICC.2019.8761146&partnerID=40&md5=709f7fd740f357d5a416d2ecbda85a8d,,Blockchain; Cryptography; Digital storage; Ethereum; Outsourcing; Cloud servers; Encrypted data; Privacy preserving; Publicly verifiable; Query results; Security analysis; Security design; Verifiable designs; Data privacy,Conference Paper,Final,,2-s2.0-85070237152

The integrity and availability of medical data are the basic guarantee for the smooth operation of these activities. The privacy of medical data is a natural demand from the sensitivity of medical data. At present, there are mainly two ways to protect the privacy of medical data. One way is to store medical data in a local database and set up an access control strategy of the database. The other way is to encrypt medical data with the patient’s key and to share the key when needed. The problem with the first method is that the data in the local database may be modified or deleted. The problem with the second method is that the key cannot be shared when the patient dies during the diagnosis and treatment. These two problems will damage the availability of data. This paper proposes to establish a shared key that could be reconstructed by the legitimate parties before the process of diagnosis and treatment begins. The data in the diagnosis and treatment process is encrypted and stored in a blockchain using the shared key. The proposal meets the integrity, availability and privacy requirements of medical data. It uses the sibling intractable function families (SIFF) to establish a shared key, and uses the Hyperledger Fabric to store encrypted data. The simulation shows that the system has good efficiency. Additionally, it is the first time to introduce SIFF to a blockchain application. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,,Journal of Medical Systems,49.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059493183&doi=10.1007%2fs10916-018-1144-x&partnerID=40&md5=528fb4d9e7d05b8935ee90b7b2a9bef8,Availability; Blockchain; Integrity; Medical data; Privacy,accident; adult; article; control strategy; human; privacy; sibling; simulation; computer security; confidentiality; electronic health record; medical information system; organization and management; standards; Computer Security; Confidentiality; Electronic Health Records; Health Information Exchange; Humans,Article,Final,,2-s2.0-85059493183

Building upon the existing body of knowledge, we propose a design theory, including requirements, design principles, and features, for a blockchain-based sensor data protection system (SDPS) that leverages data certification. To support this, we designed and developed an instantiation of an SDPS (CertifiCar) in three iterative cycles intented to prevent the fraudulent manipulation of car mileage data.

However, the data collected and processed by IoT systems especially the ones with centralized control are vulnerable to availability, integrity, and privacy threats. Hence, we present “PrivySharing,” a blockchain-based innovative framework for integrity and privacy-preserving IoT data sharing in a smart city environment. The proposed scheme is distinct from existing technologies on many aspects. The data privacy is preserved by dividing the blockchain network into various channels, where every channel processes a specific type of data such as health, smart car, smart energy or financial data. Moreover, access to user data within a channel is controlled by embedding access control rules in the smart contracts. In addition, users' data within a channel is further isolated and secured by using private data collection. Likewise, the REST API that enables clients to interact with the blockchain network has dual security in the form of an API Key and OAuth 2.0. The proposed solution also conforms to some of the significant requirements outlined in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. Lastly, we present a system of reward in the form of a digital token “PrivyCoin” for the users for sharing their data with the stakeholders/third parties.

In order to record the SHS device information transaction, we propose a new block data structure based on homomorphic encryption (HEBDS). Using the HCB-SDPP model, we design an encrypted algorithm based on Paillier encrypted for privacy protection. To verify the validity of the HCB-SDPP model, we firstly encrypt sensitive data of all gateway peers and upload them to the consortium blockchain. Then, we validate the security of sensitive data after homomorphic encryption processing. In the experiment, we also design attack experiments to attack different types of peers on the consortium blockchain in the HCB-SDPP model.

While this classic method of granting consent is familiar to the parties involved, it involves little accountability or ongoing access oversight. Parents are asked to sign multiple permission forms, but are not given an efficient manner by which they can differentiate between fields for consent nor keep track of usage. Blockchain technology represents a promising approach for developing 'smart contracts', digital promises to be executed without reliance upon a legal intermediary. Utilizing Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Composer, we propose a framework of nested authorization, allowing a public school data administrator the ability to grant authorization rights to a third party afterschool intervention program and their volunteers, who meet with parents and obtain consent for data access rights relying on smart contracts.

In recent years, blockchain has been proposed to be a promising solution to achieve personal health information (PHI) sharing with security and privacy preservation due to its advantages of immutability. This work proposes a blockchain-based secure and privacy-preserving PHI sharing (BSPP) scheme for diagnosis improvements in e-Health systems. Firstly, two kinds of blockchains, private blockchain and consortium blockchain, are constructed by devising their data structures, and consensus mechanisms. The private blockchain is responsible for storing the PHI while the consortium blockchain keeps records of the secure indexes of the PHI. In order to achieve data security, access control, privacy preservation and secure search, all the data including the PHI, keywords and the patients’ identity are public key encrypted with keyword search. Furthermore, the block generators are required to provide proof of conformance for adding new blocks to the blockchains, which guarantees the system availability. Security analysis demonstrates that the proposed protocol can meet with the security goals. Furthermor, we implement the proposed scheme on JUICE to evaluate the performance. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,,Journal of Medical Systems,292.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049116418&doi=10.1007%2fs10916-018-0995-5&partnerID=40&md5=d35d443ba19c6142ce30e1737e491347,Blockchain; e-Health; Personal Health Information (PHI); Privacy preservation; Security,adult; article; computer security; consensus; diagnosis; human; identity; medical information; privacy; telehealth; confidentiality; electronic health record; information dissemination; telemedicine; Computer Security; Confidentiality; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Information Dissemination; Privacy; Telemedicine,Article,Final,,2-s2.0-85049116418

Sharing health data is considered to be a critical approach to improve the quality of healthcare service and reduce medical costs. However, EMRs are fragmented across decentralized hospitals, which hinders data sharing and puts patients' privacy at risks. To address these issues, we propose a blockchain based privacy-preserving data sharing for EMRs, called BPDS. In BPDS, the original EMRs are stored securely in the cloud and the indexes are reserved in a tamper-proof consortium blockchain. By this means, the risk of the medical data leakage could be greatly reduced, and at the same time, the indexes in blockchain ensure that the EMRs can not be modified arbitrarily. Secure data sharing can be accomplished automatically according to the predefined access permissions of patients through the smart contracts of blockchain. Besides, the joint-design of the CP-ABE-based access control mechanism and the content extraction signature scheme provides strong privacy preservation in data sharing. Security analysis shows that BPDS is a secure and effective way to realize data sharing for EMRs. © 2018 IEEE.",,,"2018 IEEE Global Communications Conference, GLOBECOM 2018 - Proceedings",134.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063464219&doi=10.1109%2fGLOCOM.2018.8647713&partnerID=40&md5=f910913fc9dee414d13cf672e8289a7e,,Access control; Blockchain; Data privacy; Health care; Medical computing; Access control mechanism; Access permissions; Content extraction; Critical approach; Electronic medical record; Privacy preservation; Privacy preserving; Quality of health care; Electronic document exchange,Conference Paper,Final,"All Open Access, Green",2-s2.0-85063464219

Sharing of healthcare data is one essential step to make healthcare system smarter and improve the quality of healthcare service.

Blockchain is demonstrated in the financial field that trusted, auditable computing is possible using a decentralized network of peers accompanied by a public ledger. In this paper, we proposed an App (called Healthcare Data Gateway (HGD)) architecture based on blockchain to enable patient to own, control and share their own data easily and securely without violating privacy, which provides a new potential way to improve the intelligence of healthcare systems while keeping patient data private.
