Generally, this mechanism uses blockchain technology to supervise the original data and calculation results, which ignores the supervision of the Federated Learning model and computing process. Therefore, we introduce the concepts of the sandbox and state channel to construct a new data privacy sharing paradigm via Blockchain and Federated Learning. Under this paradigm, we use state channel to connect Blockchain and Federated Learning. And state channel is used to create a 'trusted sandbox' to instantiate Federated Learning tasks in the trustless edge computing environment. Meanwhile, we also mainly solve problems about data privacy sharing in Federated Learning and system performance degradation caused by data quality. The simulation results show that the proposed method has better performance and efficiency than the traditional data sharing method. © 1968-2012 IEEE.","Blockchain; data sharing; federated learning; privacy protection; trusted sandbox computing","Data privacy; Learning systems; Trusted computing; Block-chain; Calculation results; Computing process; Data Sharing; Federated learning; Integration mechanisms; Learning models; Modeling process; Privacy protection; Trusted sandbox computing; Blockchain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131735212

However, blockchain technology faces the problem of data availability attacks during its application, which greatly limits the scope and domain of blockchain applications. One of the most advantageous researches to address this problem is the scalable data availability solution that integrates coding theory design into the Merkle tree promise. Based on this scheme, this paper combines a zero-knowledge accumulator with higher efficiency and security with local repair coding, and proposes a data availability scheme with strong dataset privacy protection. The scheme first encodes the data block information on the blockchain to ensure tamper-proof data, and then uses a zero-knowledge accumulator to store the encoded data block information. Its main purpose is to use zero-knowledge property to protect the accumulation set information stored in the accumulator from being leaked and to ensure that no other information about the accumulation set is revealed during the data transmission. It fundamentally reduces the possibility of attackers generating fraudulent information by imitating block data and further resists data availability attacks. © 2023 by the authors.","blockchain; data availability; privacy protection; zero knowledge accumulator","Computer programming; Data privacy; Trees (mathematics); Block-chain; Data availability; Data blocks; Data privacy protections; Decentralisation; Privacy protection; Research and application; Set offs; Zero knowledge; Zero knowledge accumulator; Blockchain",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85148691722

First, the typical way of handling sensitive information can easily lead to privacy disclosure. Second, the medical system is relatively isolated. It is difficult for one medical system to share data with another, and the scope of users' activities is limited within the system boundary. To solve these two problems, we propose a new privacy-preserving medical data-sharing scheme by introducing the authorization mechanism and attribute-based encryption (ABE) based on blockchain, which breaks system boundaries and realizes data sharing among several medical institutions. ABE is used to realize scalable access control. In addition, doctors can share their knowledge to diagnose users by introducing many-to-many matching, which means that patients' health data can be represented by multiple keywords and doctors' expertise can be represented by multiple interests. We provide the correctness and security analysis of our scheme and implement a prototype tool on Ethereum.

In this paper, we present a secure and privacy-preserving data sharing protocol over the permissioned blockchains which require to certificate the users before they submit the transactions. We use the structure-preserving Groth signature to construct the anonymous credentials for satisfying the requirement of permissioned blockchains, and the anonymous credentials does not disclose the real identities of data owners. We prove that the anonymous credential in our protocol achieves the ideal functionality. For the secure access control and privacy-protection of the data accessors, we propose an efficiently anonymous authentication scheme which utilizes the ElGamal commitment and the one-out-of-many proof to ensure a data accessor is authorized, but any unauthorized entities cannot learn the real identity of the data accessor, and even the data owner does not know who (although in the access control list) and when downloads his/her data. The blockchain platform is used to record the data storing, access control list, and the storage addresses, which helps to enhance the security level of the protocol.

Its fusion processing enables the further mining of data and utilization of data value and broadens the path for the sharing and dissemination of media data. However, it also faces serious problems in terms of protecting user and data privacy. Many privacy protection methods have been proposed to solve the problem of privacy leakage during the process of data sharing, but they suffer from two flaws: 1) the lack of algorithmic frameworks for specific scenarios such as dynamic datasets in the media domain; 2) the inability to solve the problem of the high computational complexity of ciphertext in multi-source data privacy protection, resulting in long encryption and decryption times. In this paper, we propose a multi-source data privacy protection method based on homomorphic encryption and blockchain technology, which solves the privacy protection problem of multi-source heterogeneous data in the dissemination of media and reduces ciphertext processing time. We deployed the proposed method on the Hyperledger platform for testing and compared it with the privacy protection schemes based on k-anonymity and differential privacy. The experimental results show that the key generation, encryption, and decryption times of the proposed method are lower than those in data privacy protection methods based on k-anonymity technology and differential privacy technology. This significantly reduces the processing time of multi-source data, which gives it potential for use in many applications. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

Electronic Health Data (EHR) is vulnerable to security breaches, tampering, manipulation, and data leakage. The blockchain's data integrity, decentralization, and anonymity opened up new possibilities for addressing the aforementioned issues. Therefore, this paper presents a Blockchain-based Access Control Scheme (BACS) with Multiple Party Authority (MPA), smart contract, and proxy re encryption to secure the EHR. The proposed scheme consists of six phases: the registration phase, appointment phase, data aggregation stage, storage phase, query phase, and validation phase. The medical data is encrypted by using a Lightweight Fused Cryptographic (LFC) algorithm with the signature of the patient and doctor to ensure confidentiality and integrity. The encrypted EHR is then stored on Interplanetary File Systems (IPFS), which is a decentralised file storage platform. Moreover, the developed smart contract verifies the authenticity of the users, provides a reputation score for the oracle, and creates a time seal. This enhances the security of the system from external attacks as well as internal attacks. A security analysis is conducted for the proposed method, and the performance is compared with the existing techniques based on encryption time, decryption time, and computation cost. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Blockchain; Encryption; Medical Data; Oracle; Privacy; Security; Smart Contract","Access control; Blockchain; Cryptography; Data privacy; Digital storage; Network security; Block-chain; Data Sharing; Encryption schemes; Information technology security; Medical data; Network information technology; Oracle; Privacy; Privacy aware; Security; Smart contract",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85147122757

How to manage these massive data safely and reliably has become an important challenge for the medical network community. This paper proposes a data management framework of medical network community based on Consortium Blockchain (CB) and Federated learning (FL), which realizes the data security sharing between medical institutions and research institutions. Under this framework, the data security sharing mechanism of medical network community based on smart contract and the data privacy protection mechanism based on FL and alliance chain are designed to ensure the security of data and the privacy of important data in medical network community, respectively. An intelligent contract system based on Keyed-Homomorphic Public Key (KH-PKE) Encryption scheme is designed, so that medical data can be saved in the CB in the form of ciphertext, and the automatic sharing of data is realized. Zero knowledge mechanism is used to ensure the correctness of shared data. Moreover, the zero-knowledge mechanism introduces the dynamic group signature mechanism of chosen ciphertext attack (CCA) anonymity, which makes the scheme more efficient in computing and communication cost.

Data owners set up groups, generating and uploading their data to cloud storage, while other users in the groups download and make use of it, which is called group data sharing. As all kinds of cloud service, data group sharing also suffers from hardware/software failures and human errors. Provable Data Possession (PDP) schemes are proposed to check the integrity of data stored in cloud without downloading. However, there are still some unmet needs lying in auditing group shared data. Researchers propose four issues necessary for a secure group shared data auditing: public verification, identity privacy, collusion attack resistance and traceability. However, none of the published work has succeeded in achieving all of these properties so far. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based ring signature PDP scheme for group shared data, with an instance deployed on a cloud server. We design a linkable ring signature method called Linkable Homomorphic Authenticable Ring Signature (LHARS) to implement public anonymous auditing for group data.

Then, SPDTS takes full advantage of the dispersibility and immutability of blockchain to ensure the reliability of data transactions. To keep the transaction process efficient, the processing tasks for power data are performed under smart contract. Meanwhile, a trusted execution environment (TEE) is adopted to guarantee the security of power data. Finally, we present a differential privacy scheme to safeguard the privacy information in the power data. Our study indicates that the proposed scheme can achieve privacy protection, transaction security and data reliability. Also, we conduct security analysis and verify the privacy protection property of the scheme in real cases. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","blockchain; differential privacy; Power data transaction; security; zero-knowledge proof","Blockchain; Commerce; Data privacy; Reliability; Websites; Block-chain; Data transaction; Differential privacies; Power data; Power data transaction; Security; Zero-knowledge proofs; Smart contract",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132705345

Since the EHR stored in a block is accessible by the peer-to-peer (P2P) nodes, privacy has always been a matter of great concern for any blockchain-based activities.

An increasing number of companies and individuals have chosen the cloud to store their data. However, accidents, such as cloud server downtime, cloud data loss, and accidental deletion, are serious issues for some applications that need to run around the clock. For some mission and business-critical applications, the continuous availability of outsourcing storage services is also necessary to protect users' outsourced data during downtime. Nevertheless, ensuring the continuous availability of data in public cloud data integrity auditing protocols leads to data privacy issues because auditors can obtain the data content of users by a sufficient number of storage proofs.

A blockchain-based approach enables secure and convenient sharing of sensor information among different users. Compared to public and private blockchains, consortium blockchain is widely used across different industries and use cases in WSN due to its auditability and high transaction rate. However, sensing data sharing via consortium blockchain raises the privacy issue. Therefore, the data from the sensor node is encrypted by the key (named sensorkey) shared by the sensor node and the sink node and then sent to the blockchain network to not reveal the privacy of the sensing data. Since the infrastructure in large-scale WSN is usually owned and managed by multiple organizations, encrypted sensing data needs to be authorized by these multiple organizations for computation. Organizations requesting privacy-preserving data are referred to as data sharers. Distributing the sensorkey to each data sharer requires separate encryption of the key using the data sharer's public key. The sink node needs to be online when each data sharer asks for the sensorkey, and one encryption of the sensorkey for each data sharer consumes precious resources. This work proposes GSChain for efficient privacy-preserving sensing data sharing on consortium blockchain. Multiple data sharers resort to asymmetric group key agreement protocol to maintain a shared group encryption key and their respective group decryption keys, enabling efficient sensorkey retrieval from the consortium blockchain. The sensorkey is encrypted only once by the group encryption key and stored on the consortium blockchain along with the privacy-preserving sensing data. Our scheme improves the efficiency of privacy-preserving data sharing among multiple data sharers while reducing the online demand for sink nodes. Although the data-sharing group should remain stable for a long time, we design the group key update scheme. We also discuss how old and new data sharers access different ranges of privacy-preserving sensing data as the data-sharing group changes. We build a complete implementation of GSChain based on the Hyperledger Fabric framework and conduct a comprehensive set of experimental studies. Our experimental results demonstrate that GSChain improves the privacy-preserving sensing data sharing efficiency with tolerable time and storage overhead. In addition, the time overhead caused by the recovery of the GSChain system is tolerable when the membership of the data-sharing group changes. © 2022","Consortium blockchain; Data sharing; Group key agreement; Privacy preservation; Wireless sensor network","Data Sharing; Digital storage; Distributed ledger; Efficiency; Privacy-preserving techniques; Sensor nodes; Block-chain; Consortium blockchain; Data Sharing; Group key agreement; Multiple data; Multiple organizations; Privacy preservation; Privacy preserving; Sensing data; Sink nodes; Blockchain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135113560

It makes the data center check the classification result without involving an auditor. We provide the system model of the verifiable privacy-preserving data classification protocol in blockchain setting and formalize its security model. By using verifiable oblivious pseudorandom function(verifiable OPRF), we can generate a verifiable proof and post it on blockchain to guarantee the transparency of data classification.

In this paper, we present a solution for privacy-aware distributed data mining on wireless sensor networks.

The onion-routed query conceals the network identity of the sensors from external adversaries, and obfuscates the actual computation to hide it from internally compromised nodes.

Data stored in each of the healthcare institution remain in silos which cannot be easily shared with other institutions due to technical and infrastructural constraints. Hospitals do not have an effective and secure data sharing mechanism leading to monetary and resource loss in the case of a person visiting different hospitals. Blockchain, a disruptive technology with secure and reliable decentralized framework, and can be used to circumvent problems in traditional healthcare architecture for secure storage, sharing and retrieval of Electronic Health Records (EHR). A blockchain-based framework integrated with InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for EHR in healthcare management has been proposed in this paper. This proposed framework will enable healthcare institutions to maintain fail-safe and tamper-proof healthcare ledgers in a decentralized manner. Hospitals and doctors act as lightweight nodes, whereas patient nodes can be full or lightweight nodes. The model proposes two-factor authentication and multi-factor authentication for preventing fake node attacks. Patient-centric access model allows the patients to act as digital stewards for their health data, allowing access to doctors and hospitals on demand and revoking it after stipulated time. Symmetric key encryption (AES-128) is used for encrypting data before storing into IPFS. Asymmetric encryption (RSA-4096) is used for generating digital envelopes to pass on symmetric key to authorized entities. Digital signatures (RSA-1024) make sure that the transactions are valid and from authorized nodes. Hashing of the encrypted data is done using SHA-256 algorithm. Multiple layers of security implemented in this model makes sure that adversaries cannot obtain data stored in IPFS; even if they retrieve the data, it will not be meaningful since it is encrypted. The proposed framework for off-chain storage of health data using IPFS saves blockchain structure from scalability issues. Further the proposal for blockchain integration with IPFS helps preserve privacy in the healthcare system, making it highly secure, scalable and robust. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Blockchain data security; Decentralized healthcare data; Electronic health records; Healthcare data security","Authentication; Client server computer systems; Cryptography; Digital storage; Electronic document exchange; Health care; Hospitals; Network security; Records management; Block-chain; Blockchain data security; Data security and privacy; Decentralised; Decentralized healthcare data; Filesystem; Health data; Healthcare data security; Healthcare institutions; Healthcare systems; Blockchain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126923855

As a result, Federated Learning (FL) (also called collaborative learning) has emerged as a new training paradigm that allows multiple, geographically distributed nodes to learn a Deep Learning (DL) model together without sharing their data. Blockchain is becoming a new trend as data protection and privacy are concerns in many sectors. Technology is leading the world and transforming into a global village where everything is accessible and transparent. We have presented a blockchain enabled security model using FL that can generate an enhanced DL model without sharing data and improve privacy through higher security and access rights to data. However, existing FL approaches also have unique security vulnerabilities that malicious actors can exploit and compromise the trained model. The FL method is compared to the other known approaches. Users are more likely to choose the latter option, i.e., providing local but private data to the server and using ML apps, performing ML operations on the devices without benefiting from other users’ data, and preventing direct access to raw data and local training of ML models. FL protects data privacy and reduces data transfer overhead by storing raw data on devices and combining locally computed model updates. We have investigated the feasibility of data and model poisoning attacks under a blockchain-enabled FL system built alongside the Ethereum network and the traditional FL system (without blockchain). This work fills a knowledge gap by proposing a transparent incentive mechanism that can encourage good behavior among participating decentralized nodes and avoid common problems and provides knowledge for the FL security literature by investigating current FL systems. © 2022 by the authors.

On a daily basis in smart cities, the IoT generates a large amount of data (big data) which could potentially be used for questionable or suspect purposes by attackers.

Mostly, the records are stored on healthcare cloud and application (HCA) servers, and thus, are subjected to end-user latency, extensive computations, single-point failures, and security and privacy risks. A joint solution is required to address the issues of responsive analytics, coupled with high data ingestion in HBD and secure EHR access. Motivated from the research gaps, the paper proposes a scheme, that integrates blockchain (BC)-based confidentiality-privacy (CP) preserving scheme, CP-BDHCA, that operates in two phases. In the first phase, elliptic curve cryptographic (ECC)-based digital signature framework, HCA-ECC is proposed to establish a session key for secure communication among different healthcare entities. Then, in the second phase, a two-step authentication framework is proposed that integrates Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and advanced encryption standard (AES), named as HCA-RSAE that safeguards the ecosystem against possible attack vectors. CP-BDAHCA is compared against existing HCA cloud applications in terms of parameters like response time, average delay, transaction and signing costs, signing and verifying of mined blocks, and resistance to DoS and DDoS attacks. We consider 10 BC nodes and create a real-world customized dataset to be used with SEER dataset. The dataset has 30,000 patient profiles, with 1000 clinical accounts. Based on the combined dataset the proposed scheme outperforms traditional schemes like AI4SAFE, TEE, Secret, and IIoTEED, with a lower response time. For example, the scheme has a very less response time of 300 ms in DDoS. The average signing cost of mined BC transactions is 3,34 seconds, and for 205 transactions, has a signing delay of 1405 ms, with improved accuracy of ≈ 12% than conventional state-of-the-art approaches. © 2013 IEEE.","Big Data; Blockchain; DoS and DDoS attacks; ECC signatures; Healthcare Cloud and Applications; pairing-based cryptography; secure session key management","Authentication; Big data; Blockchain; Cryptography; Electronic document exchange; Health care; Network security; Privacy by design; Advanced Encryption Standard; Cloud applications; Denial of Service; Electronic health record; Privacy preserving; Security and privacy; Single point failure; State-of-the-art approach; Denial-of-service attack; adult; article; big data; blockchain; cloud computing; confidentiality; controlled study; denial of service attack; ecosystem; electronic health record; encryption; human; ingestion; medical service; privacy; reaction time; computer security; confidentiality; ecosystem; health care delivery; privacy; Big Data; Blockchain; Computer Security; Confidentiality; Delivery of Health Care; Ecosystem; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Privacy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110818554

However, provenance graphs have the graph structure containing sensitive information including the records as well as the linkages between the records. Both need to be kept secret from the unauthorized users including the blockchain peers. Storing the record linkages on blockchain in a privacy-preserving manner is challenging because (1) past records cannot be modified due to the tamper-proofness, (2) efficient graph tracking/tracing on blockchain is necessary for a provenance system on blockchain, and (3) the size of the records' pointer may leak the volume of linkages. Existing approaches either fail to provide linkage privacy protection to the provenance graph, could only support less-complicated structure such as tree, or leak the volume of linkages from the block sizes. We present Trac2Chain, a framework that provides complete linkage privacy as well as full tracking/tracing functions for the provenance graphs stored on blockchain. The novel graph storage design in Trac2Chain allows generation of the provenance dependencies of arbitrary graph structure while still enjoying the tamper-proofness of blockchain.

However, due to the insufficient local computing and storage resources of IoT devices, logistics records with sensitive information are generally stored in a centralized cloud center, which could easily cause privacy leakage. In this study, we propose a blockchain-assisted secure storage scheme for logistics data. To be specific, this scheme can be briefly divided into two parts. The first part involves data generation and aggregation, session establishing, records encryption and storage, wherein a blockchain network is used to assist the cloud server with data storage, and smart contracts are deployed to provide reliable storage interfaces. In the second part, an efficient consensus mechanism is introduced to improve the efficiency of the consensus process. Also, the stored records can be securely audited by leveraging the deployed blockchain network. Finally, we analyze the security and privacy properties of this scheme and evaluate its performance in terms of computation and communication overhead by developing an experimental platform. The experimental results indicate that the performance of our scheme is acceptable. © 2014 IEEE.","Blockchain; consensus mechanism; logistics data; secure storage; smart logistics","Blockchain; Cryptography; Digital storage; Privacy by design; Communication overheads; Experimental platform; Internet of thing (IOT); Logistics network; Privacy preserving; Security and privacy; Sensitive informations; Storage resources; Internet of things",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113885671

However, the collected data may contain users' sensitive information. When guaranteeing the utility of data, we need to consider privacy of users' data. To balance the utility and the privacy of data, the existing approaches usually adopt the privacy-preserving signature technology, where the privacy-preserving data are classified by a designated converter (data processor) interacting with a semihonest verifier (data center). However, for the malicious behavior of the data center and data processor, this kind of approach is insufficient.

Such raw data needs to be stored and accessed from a non-proprietary database while the obfuscation and encryption techniques on current cloud-based proprietary solutions incur data losses that are deemed inefficient for accurate usage, particularly in time-sensitive real-time operations. In this paper, we target the problem of scalably storing and retrieving potentially sensitive data generated by vehicles and propose TREAD, a blockchain-based system comprising smart contracts to store this mobility data on a distributed ledger such that multiple peers can access and utilize it in different location-based applications while not revealing users’ sensitive personal information. It is, however, challenging to scalably store large amounts of constantly generated trajectories, and to achieve scalability we leverage InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a scalable distributed peer-to-peer data storage system. To avoid users injecting malicious/fake trajectories into the ledger, we develop efficient consensus algorithms for the stakeholders to validate the storage and retrieval process in a distributed manner. We implemented TREAD on the open-source Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform using trajectory data generated for 700 vehicles in a simulation environment well calibrated with vehicle trajectories from a real-world test-bed in New York City.

With the increase in industrial equipment (e.g., smart mobile terminals, sensors, and other embedded devices) in the Internet of Things and the advent of Industry 4.0, there has been an explosion of data generated that is characterized by a high volume but small size. How to manage and protect sensitive private data in data sharing has become an urgent issue for enterprises. Traditional data sharing and storage relies on trusted third-party platforms or distributed cloud storage, but these approaches run the risk of single-node failure, and third parties and cloud storage providers can be vulnerable to attacks that can lead to data theft. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain-based secure data transfer scheme for enterprises in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT). We store raw data in the IIoT in the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) network after encryption and store the Keyword-index table we designed in Hyperledger Fabric blockchain, and enterprises share the data by querying the Keyword-index table. We use Fabric’s channel mechanism combined with our designed Chaincode to achieve privacy protection and efficient data transmission while using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) to ensure data integrity. Finally, we performed security analysis and experiments on the proposed scheme, and the results show that overall the data transfer performance in the IPFS network is generally better than the traditional network, In the case of transferring 5 MB file size data, the transmission speed and latency of IPFS are 19.23 mb/s and 0.26 s, respectively, and the IPFS network is almost 4 times faster than the TCP/IP network while taking only a quarter of the time, which is more advantageous when transferring small files, such as data in the IIOT. In addition, our scheme outperforms the blockchain systems mainly used today in terms of both throughput, latency, and system overhead. The average throughput of our solution can reach 110 tps (transactions are executed per second), and the minimum throughput in experimental tests can reach 101 tps. © 2022 by the authors.","Chaincode; Data security sharing; Hyperledger Fabric blockchain; Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT); IPFS; Privacy-preserved","Cryptography; Data privacy; Data transfer; Digital storage; Distributed ledger; Electronic document identification systems; Internet of things; Block-chain; Chain codes; Data security sharing; Data Sharing; Filesystem; Hyperledg fabric blockchain; Industrial internet of thing; Inter-planetary file system; Privacy-preserved; Systems networks; Blockchain; article; blockchain; cloud computing; data integrity; encryption; experimental test; information security; internet of things; privacy; theft; velocity",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123872454

This sophisticated paradigm allows for minimal operational costs, significant flexibility, and the use of electronic health records (EHRs). However, for e-health systems, this new paradigm poses concerns regarding data privacy and network security. It’s a challenging problem to exchange EHRs consistently among mobile users while maintaining high-security levels in the mobile cloud. It’s a challenging problem to exchange EHRs consistently among mobile users while maintaining high-security levels in the mobile cloud. Here, this paper intends to introduce a novel blockchain technology for secure health data in the cloud, which aids in ensuring authentication and offers integrity to medical records. Here, blockchain with optimal encryption is deployed via an improved blowfish model that also guarantees authentication features. Further, the optimal key generation is carried out by a new approach termed as Elephant Herding Optimization with Opposition-based Learning (EHO-OBL). Thus, the data integrity is maintained by the developed approach, and at last, the supremacy of the presented approach is proved concerning various measures.

The user identity privacy is improved here by hiding the relationship between the input address and the actual output address. Many existing mechanisms like basic-stealth address, double-key stealth address (DKSAP), improved stealth address and perfected double-key stealth address were proposed earlier. But the commonly used double-key stealth address protocol (DKSAP) mandates that the sender delivers the temporary public key along with the transaction, making it possible for attackers to discriminate between stealth and non-stealth transactions and causing a privacy leakage risk. While in the perfected double-key, stealth address protocol, senders and receivers keep track of the number of transactions they have with other users in local transaction record databases. To prevent the temporary key for a transaction from being leaked, senders and receivers generate a temporary key pair based on the number of transactions that have happened between them. We propose a randomized addressing model, where the sender creates a one-time address for every transaction based on their last transaction id and the public key of the receiver which restricts the attacker to track the user identity and transaction information. To improve the real estate technology via the blockchain, the proposed model is deployed in a blockchain-based commercial real estate platform. Finally, we verify the proposed protocol by comparing it with the existing techniques in terms of different performance metrics. Based on the security analysis results obtained, the proposed methodology tends to be efficient in terms of privacy protection, receiver anonymity, copyright protection, and anti-tampering. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Blockchain; Elliptic curve cryptography; Information security; Privacy protection; Stealth address protocol","Copyrights; Data transfer; Privacy-preserving techniques; Public key cryptography; Block-chain; Curve cryptography; Elliptic curve; Elliptic curve cryptography; Privacy preserving; Privacy protection; Public keys; Real-estates; Stealth address protocol; User identity; Blockchain",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85142395763

However, due to the loosely coupled nature, it is vulnerable to many attacks, resulting in some security threats to the IoT system, but it cannot provide the basic security mechanisms such as authentication and confidentiality to ensure the data security.

With the addition of smart contracts, blockchains can track and verify arbitrary computations - which enables blockchain users to verify the provenance of information derived from data through the blockchain. This provenance comes at the cost of data confidentiality and user privacy, however, which is unacceptable for many sensitive applications. The need for verifiable yet confidential data sharing and computation has led some to add trusted execution environment (TEE) hardware to blockchain platforms. By moving sensitive operations (e.g., data decryption and analysis) off of the blockchain and into a TEE, they get both the confidentiality of TEEs and the transparency of blockchains without the need to completely trust any one party in the data-sharing ecosystem.In this paper, we build on our TEE-enabled blockchain data-sharing system, Amanuensis, to ensure the freshness of access-control lists shared between the blockchain and TEE, and to improve the privacy of users interacting within the system.

However, despite increased attention to the security of electronic health records, patient privacy is still at risk for data breaches. Thus, it is quite a challenge to involve an access control system especially if the patient's medical data are accessible by users who have diverse privileges in different situations. Blockchain is a new technology that can be adopted for decentralized access control management issues. Nevertheless, different scalability, security, and privacy challenges affect this technology. To address these issues, we suggest a novel Decentralized Self-Management of data Access Control (DSMAC) system using a blockchain-based Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) model for privacy-preserving medical data, empowering patients with mechanisms to preserve control over their personal information and allowing them to self-grant access rights to their medical data.

Finally, by evaluating performance and comparing analyses with other schemes, DSMAC can satisfy the privacy requirements of medical systems in terms of privacy, scalability, and sustainability, and offers a new approach for emergency cases. © 2013 IEEE.","Blockchain; data privacy; decentralized access control; decentralized identifier (DID); IoMT sensors; self sovereign identity (SSI); smart contract; verifiable credential (VC)","Access control; Blockchain; Health risks; Information management; Medical information systems; mHealth; Mobile telecommunication systems; Privacy-preserving techniques; Scalability; Block-chain; Data access control; Decentralised; Decentralized access control; Decentralized identifier; IoMT sensor; Medical data; Self management; Self sovereign identity; Verifiable credential; Smart contract",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139447854

Maintaining the value stability of RMB payment means and the security and efficiency of RMB settlement system are the key measures to promote the internationalization of RMB. Aiming at the problem of data insecurity and untrustworthiness in traditional information systems, this paper proposes a data protection technology for information systems based on blockchain. In the hierarchical authority information system, multichain structure is adopted to divide the authority of nodes in each layer, so that only the nodes with corresponding authority can access and operate data. Private digital currency, which is based on blockchain technology and represented by payment token and stable currency, helps to improve the defects of the agent banking model but increases additional market risks and trust risks. Blockchain technology adopts special networking technology and consensus mechanism.

Blockchain-assisted data aggregation enables the traceability of sensing data to improve the trustworthiness of data aggregation results. However, directly using blockchains for data aggregation may introduce the risk of privacy leakage because all nodes, including malicious nodes, can access the data on blockchains. In this paper, we propose a grouping-based reliable privacy-preserving data aggregation (RPPDA) method using private blockchains for mobile crowdsensing. First, the sensing nodes are divided into multiple groups, and each group maintains a private blockchain to store the data aggregation records, which avoids the leakage of the aggregated results and ensures the traceability of the sensory data. Then, a zero-sum noise-adding mechanism is utilized to not only preserve the private information during aggregation and ensure the correctness of the aggregated results but also improve the efficiency of privacy preservation. Furthermore, we theoretically prove the correctness, privacy, efficiency, and reliability of the proposed RPPDA algorithm.

The procedure of exchanging medical information is increasingly concerned with data privacy. Many techniques have been offered for preserving data security. These techniques use approaches such as (Formula presented.) -anonymity, (Formula presented.) -diversity, and others. However, such solutions are vulnerable to attribute disclosure, homogeneity, and background knowledge risks due to their syntactic nature. In this work, we describe a safe and secure architecture and semantic approach for data sharing that is based on blockchain, local differential privacy (LDP), and federated learning (FL). The proposed framework generates an atmosphere devoid of trust in which data owners are no longer required to have trust in the controllers. The FL models enable the whole network to decentralize its data-driven learning. Interplanetary file system (IPFS) is used to provide data security in a distributed environment because each file in IPFS has a digital fingerprint that is computed using a cryptographic hash function on the file's whole contents. Due to the rigorous privacy guarantee, data owners no longer need to be worried about the security of their data. The proposed model's assessment parameters include latency, throughput, privacy, and accuracy. The data privacy of the proposed model is protected via LDP and FL, and its latency and throughput communication transactions on permissioned blockchain are calculated and compared with those of the benchmark model.

Unfortunately, current personal data privacy protection schemes still suffer from explicit storage, lack of data ownership and implementation of fine-grained access control by users, and lack of transparency and auditability of data. In this article, we propose a personal data privacy protection scheme based on consortium blockchain that stores original data encrypted with an improved Paillier homomorphic encryption mechanism, namely PDPChain, where users realize fine-grained access control based on ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) on blockchain. In this scheme, consortium blockchain combines distributed private clusters to store the encrypted data, improving data transmission efficiency, and guaranteeing user privacy and security through off-chain storage and on-chain transmission synergy. In addition, it is more lightweight encryption and demarcation, ultimately protecting personal data privacy and providing a secure and trusted way to obtain information for data mining. For the performance testing, data in the form of files are used as an example, and the scheme is designed and simulated on Hyperledger Fabric and InterPlanetary File System. Experimental results show that the improved Paillier encryption mechanism reduces the overall encryption and decryption elapsed time by 25&#x0025; and encryption elapsed time by 48&#x0025;.

It is beneficial for remote-access transactions over telecommunication networks. Presently, this task is the most challenging one for researchers. People's mental status in the form of emotions is quite complex, and its complexity depends upon internal behavior. Emotion and facial behavior are essential characteristics through which human internal thought can be predicted. Speech is one of the mechanisms through which human's various internal reflections can be expected and extracted by focusing on the vocal track, the flow of voice, voice frequency, etc. Human voice specimens of different ages can be emotions that can be predicted through a deep learning approach using feature removal behavior prediction that will help build a step intelligent healthcare system strong and provide data to various doctors of medical institutes and hospitals to understand the physiological behavior of humans. Healthcare is a clinical area with data concentrated where many details are accessed, generated, and circulated periodically. Healthcare systems with many existing approaches like tracing and tracking continuously disclose the system's constraints in controlling patient data privacy and security. In the healthcare system, majority of the work involves swapping or using decisively confidential and personal data. A key issue is the modeling of approaches that guarantee the value of health-related data while protecting privacy and observing high behavioral standards. This will encourage large-scale perception, especially as healthcare information collection is expected to continue far off this current ongoing pandemic. So, the research section is looking for a privacy-preserving, secure, and sustainable system by using a technology called Blockchain. Data related to healthcare and distribution among institutions is a very challenging task. Storage of facts in the centralized form is a targeted choice for cyber hackers and initiates an accordant sight of patients' facts which will cause a problem in sharing information over a network.

Moreover, the in-depth research and development of 6G and AI technology further strengthen the interconnection of various entities in VANET and can realize edge intelligence, which fundamentally enhances the efficiency of data sharing. However, reliable transmission and secure storage of data have always been a great challenge in data sharing. Although some schemes store shared data in the blockchain, most of the consensus mechanisms they use employ full nodes to verify signature information and timestamps, which cannot effectively judge the reliability of the shared data itself. Some other schemes use scoring mechanisms to evaluate data uploaded by vehicles, but these methods can be affected by network hardware failures and cannot effectively detect duplicate data. In addition, participants' privacy may also be disclosed in the process of data sharing, such as participants' location and identity information. Therefore, to address the above problems, this paper proposes a data sharing scheme in 6G-VANET, which can not only ensure the reliability and security of shared data but also protect the privacy of participants. Firstly, a consortium chain is adopted to realize the secure storage of shared data in 6G-VANET, which meets the requirements of tamper-proof and traceability of data. Secondly, a voting consensus mechanism is designed in combination with smart contract to ensure the reliability of data. Thirdly, the trained word2vec natural language processing model is deployed to edge nodes to realize edge intelligence, effectively eliminate the duplicate shared data, and enhance storage efficiency. Finally, a participant privacy protection mechanism is designed using the Private Set Intersection (PSI) protocol, and a secure and efficient data sharing scheme is finally realized. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by security analysis and experimental evaluation. The experimental results show that the time and space overhead of blockchain can meet the practical requirements, and the proposed PSI protocol of large-scale vehicles can be completed in a short time. © 2022 Zhihua Wang et al.",,"Blockchain; Data privacy; Digital storage; Intelligent systems; Natural language processing systems; Network security; Reliability; Storage efficiency; Vehicles; Block-chain; Data Sharing; Edge intelligence; Intersection protocols; Privacy protection; Secure storage; Set intersection; Shared data; Sharing schemes; Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs); Vehicular ad hoc networks",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135259035

In this paper, we propose a privacy protection scheme for multidimensional data aggregation and access control in the cloud Internet of Things for smart grid. The scalable access control based on attribute encryption is used to determine the data security of power user data in the process of data information sharing in the blockchain under the large data traffic of the cloud platform, which is to achieve privacy protection and fine-grained access control for demand-side multidimensional data. By using the EBGN homomorphic encryption algorithm, the multidimensional data is encrypted, and each dimension can be decrypted separately using the corresponding private key. The multidimensional data aggregation at the gateway can aggregate the multidimensional data into cipher-text, and the control center does not need to decrypt the cipher-text data of each dimension, thereby simplifying the operation of the gateway and the control center and improving the security and privacy of the data. By encrypting the EBGN private key of each dimension through the cipher-text policy attribute encryption algorithm, the fine-grained access control at the dimension level is realized. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the security of private data in the aspect of multidimensional data privacy protection, thus reducing the security risk of multidimensional data being illegally accessed.

However, the heterogeneity of information systems used by various medical institutions makes sharing difficult. In addition, since medical data involves a great deal of sensitive information, sharing it could easily lead to the leakage of personal privacy. Blockchain, gained popularity as a distributed ledger technology, has great potential to connect heterogeneous systems and provides authenticity and integrity guarantees for medical data sharing. Focusing on the issues of medical data sharing and privacy protection, we propose a medical data sharing scheme based on consortium blockchain. To achieve access control, attribute-based access control technique is implemented, where patients preset attribute-specific access policies for their medical records, and record requesters are described by a set of attributes. For patients, we devise a hybrid storage mode to write access policies of medical records on the consortium blockchain network and store encrypted medical records off-chain. Leveraging blockchain and smart contracts, access privilege control and access history tracking can be realized. To enhance the key management, a tree of medical records is constructed for each patient, and by simply keeping the medical record trees, patients can recover their encryption keys at any time.

Therefore, safe and reliable data publishing among multiple data owners is an urgent problem to be solved. We mainly study the problem of privacy protection in data publishing. For a centralized scenario, we propose the LDA-DP algorithm. First, the within-class mean vectors and the pooled within-class scatter matrix are perturbed by the Gaussian noise. Second, the optimal projection direction vector with differential privacy is obtained by the Fisher criterion. Finally, the low-dimensional projection data of the original data are obtained.

First, the within-class mean vectors and within-class scatter matrices of local data are perturbed by the Gaussian noise and uploaded to the blockchain network. Second, the projection direction vector is calculated in the blockchain network and returned to the data owner. Finally, the data owner uses the projection direction vector to generate low-dimensional projection data of the original data and upload it to the blockchain network for publishing.

Blockchain will facilitate effective data exchange while maintaining patient privacy and data protection. Cloud data has long been a draw for cyber attackers. Today, cloud health data has been their latest interest. The cloud-based application that theoretically transforms the operation and communication of existing healthcare networks is EHR. The EHR is a digital file comprising the personal details of citizens/patients (name, photo, address, age, etc.) and health (existing diseases, previous surgeries, allergies, blood type, allergies, vaccinations, etc.). Maximizing cost efficiency is one of the drivers for integrating cloud services in health care. The return on investment for healthcare services is better when using cloud solutions. The cloud infrastructure includes a centralized medical record entry point, allowing many clinicians to display laboratory reports or consult patient notes. Loud technologies would allow researchers to explore these data and analyses public health more accurately. Cloud technology is not the best way to handle the medical services and records of the healthcare system. Nevertheless, this technology allows patients and physicians access to software that will enhance patient care. The Cloud also provides an excellent opportunity to utilize patient data on a health computer scale to draw insights on health and allow patients to manage personal details quickly and efficiently. There are hurdles in introducing emerging technologies and threatening privacy violations, but health services will utilize this increasingly growing and valuable technology with the appropriate training and framework.

It has been analyzed that previous works are primarily dependent on the centralized data storage approach, which raises privacy concerns. The previous works also do not emphasize handling big medical data and lack the reliability of the end-to-end security features system. This paper has presented an authorization framework for ensuring data security and privacy preservation using blockchain technology with IPFS as decentralized file storage and sharing system. The proposed study devises a proof of replication algorithm using smart contracts to provide a better access control mechanism. The implementation of the proposed framework is based on the symmetric encryption and Ethereum blockchain platform. The study outcome illustrates the efficiency and availability of the proposed scheme compared to the typical cloud-based blockchain method. © 2022.

However, the development of these new technologies makes users' privacy vulnerable. The threats on private data may arise from service providers themselves voluntarily or by inadvertence. As a result, the data owner would like to ensure that the collected data are securely stored and accessed only by authorised users. In this paper, we propose a novel data-owner centric privacy model in IoT/cloud environment. Our model combines two promising paradigms for data privacy, which are attribute-based encryption (ABE) and blockchain, to strengthen the data-owner privacy protection. We propose a new scheme of ABE that is, in one hand, suitable to resource-constrained devices by externalising the computing capabilities, thanks to fog computing paradigm and, in the other hand, combined with a blockchain-based protocol to overcome a single point of trust and to enhance data-owner access control.

AR integrates the digital visuals into a virtual space that emulates the real-world feedback for the user. It supports a range of haptic and interactive communication and thus has attracted the interest of the research community to provide useful AR frameworks. However, as the user-private data is communicated through open channels, it raises privacy and security concerns. In parallel, decentralized computing has shifted resource provisioning to near device interactions that support the real-time connectivity of AR. To preserve privacy and induce trust among AR stakeholders, blockchain (BC)-based AR use cases are presented by researchers. However, the existing surveys have not focused on reference architectures and implementation challenges. Motivated by the research gap, the paper presents a systematic survey of the integration of BC to induce data privacy in AR ecosystems. A comparative analysis is presented, and the potential application of BC-based AR is discussed. A case study on VoRtex enterprise is presented, and a supporting architectural framework is discussed.

Educational Institutes stored and shared their digitally stored data with other institutes or Vendors for various purposes like issuing certificate, so protecting the privacy while sharing the data is a problem of researchers. People create a large number of files every day and wish to save them somewhere. However, they usually rely on unsecure centralized systems. Block chain is a decentralized system that keeps files and data safe. The suggested model will eliminate all cloud storage limits. It uses a block chain and an interplanetary file system to operate. It divides educational data files into blocks and then encrypts each block with hash keysOur goal is to come up with a privacy-preserving method for sharing data via block chain.

The remarkable security feature of the blockchain is that the blockchain verifies the transaction initiated on each block through the node, and its process is broadcast throughout the whole network to let everyone know. On the one hand, this ensures the security of every transaction, but on the other hand, it is easy to cause privacy disclosure problems for transaction users. Therefore, under the premise of ensuring the security of the blockchain, it has become a hot issue to protect the sensitive information of transaction users. A check-in privacy protection (CPP) algorithm based on check-in location generalization is proposed in this paper, which can be applied to blockchain transactions to solve the privacy leakage problem of transaction users' sensitive information. CPP algorithm not only protects the privacy of check-in data but also keeps the high utility of trajectory pattern data. Firstly, location types are recommended in the sensitive check-in location generalization based on the user's trajectory pattern by using Markov chain technology. Secondly, to make sure that the generalized locations can be scattered as much as possible to prevent the attacker from deducing back, a heuristic rule is designed to select the generalized location based on the recommended location types, and at the same time, the similarity between the anonymous trajectory and the original trajectory is maintained. In addition, a generalized location search strategy is designed to improve the efficiency of the algorithm. Based on the real spatial-temporal check-in data, the results of the experiment indicate that our algorithm can effectively protect the privacy of sensitive check-in while ensuring the high utility of trajectory pattern data. © 2022 Xiufeng Xia et al.",,"Location; Markov processes; Privacy-preserving techniques; Trajectories; Block-chain; Check-in; Digital tokens; Financial industry; Generalisation; Pattern datum; Privacy protection; Protection algorithms; Sensitive informations; Trajectory pattern; Blockchain",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127845776

To solve the problem that the relatively low security of vehicles connected to the Internet may threaten the privacy of users, a blockchain-based sensitive data privacy-protection scheme for vehicles connected to the Internet is proposed. First, association rules are used to mine big data in the Internet of Vehicles. Then, a data security aggregation protocol is established. Finally, an end-to-end encryption mechanism is created. The privacy protection of big data in the Internet of Vehicles is achieved through static and dynamic strategies. The experimental results show that the scheme can improve the hiding rate of sensitive data, the key generation time and encryption time are shorter than those of typical technologies, and the encryption ability is better.

Health data are usually collected from edge-based Internet of medical things (IoMT) with devices such as smart wearable devices, smart watches, and smartphones. Since health data are highly private and have great financial value, adversaries ceaselessly launch diverse attacks to obtain private information. All these issues pose great challenges to health data sharing in edge-based IoMT scenarios. Existing research either lacks comprehensive consideration of privacy and security protection or fails to provide a proper incentive mechanism, which expels users from sharing data. In this study, we propose a novel blockchain-assisted data sharing scheme, which allows secure and privacy-preserving profile matching. A bloom filter with hash functions is designed to verify the authenticity of keyword ciphertext. Key-policy attribute-based encryption (KP-ABE) algorithm and smart contracts are employed to achieve secure profile matching. To incentivize users actively participating in profile matching, we devise an incentive mechanism and construct a two-phase Stackelberg game to address pricing problems for data owners and accessing problems of data requesters. The optimal pricing mechanism is specially designed for encouraging more users to participate in health data sharing and maximizing users’ profit. Moreover, security analysis illustrates that the proposed protocol is capable of satisfying various security goals, while performance evaluation shows high scalability and feasibility of the proposed scheme in edge-based IoMT scenarios.

We propose a secure and trusted agricultural product traceability system (BCST-APTS), which is supported by blockchain and CP-ABE encryption technology.

Existing smart healthcare systems facilitate the patient to reserve a particular time slot and attain real-time healthcare information. However, most of these systems need sensitive information about patients, i.e., desired destination of the healthcare providers. Moreover, existing systems utilize a centralized system which makes these systems vulnerable to numerous intruders’ attacks and security breaches (particularly related to service providers) and results in single-point failure of the entire system. In this paper, Ring Signature for permissioned Block-chain-based Private Information Retrieval scheme is proposed to improve privacy-preserving in the smart healthcare system. Our proposed Scheme initially utilizes an improved multi-transaction mode consortium block-chain constructed by different numbers of requests to the healthcare providers to achieve maximized appointment offers based on availability, transparency, and security.

In the battle against the outbreak of COVID-19, how to manage and share the COVID-19 Electric Medical Records (CEMRs) safely and effectively in the world, prevent malicious users from tampering with CEMRs, and protect the privacy of patients are very worthy of attention. In particular, the semi-trusted medical cloud platform has become the primary means of hospital medical data management and information services. Security and privacy issues in the medical cloud platform are more prominent and should be addressed with priority. To address these issues, on the basis of ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption, we propose a blockchain-empowered security and privacy protection scheme with traceable and direct revocation for COVID-19 medical records. In this scheme, we perform the blockchain for uniform identity authentication and all public keys, revocation lists, etc are stored on a blockchain. The system manager server is responsible for generating the system parameters and publishes the private keys for the COVID-19 medical practitioners and users. The cloud service provider (CSP) stores the CEMRs and generates the intermediate decryption parameters using policy matching. The user can calculate the decryption key if the user has private keys and intermediate decrypt parameters. Only when attributes are satisfied access policy and the user's identity is out of the revocation list, the user can get the intermediate parameters by CSP. The malicious users may track according to the tracking list and can be directly revoked. The security analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme is indicated to be safe under the Decision Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) assumption and can resist many attacks. The simulation experiment demonstrates that the communication and storage overhead is less than other schemes in the public-private key generation, CEMRs encryption, and decryption stages. Besides, we also verify that the proposed scheme works well in the blockchain in terms of both throughput and delay. © 2013 IEEE.","Blockchain; COVID-19; electronic medical records.; security and privacy protection; traceable and revocation","Blockchain; Cryptography; Digital storage; Information management; Information services; Privacy by design; Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryptions; Global public health; Medical data management; Privacy preserving; Security analysis; Security and privacy issues; Security and privacy protection; Storage overhead; Data Sharing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112670673

As genomic data contain various privacy-sensitive information, security schemes that protect confidentiality and control access are essential. Many security techniques have been proposed to safeguard healthcare data. However, these techniques are inadequate for genomic data management because of their large size. Additionally, privacy problems due to the sharing of gene data are yet to be addressed. In this study, we propose a secure genomic data management system using blockchain and local differential privacy (LDP). The proposed system employs two types of storage: private storage for internal staff and semi-private storage for external users. In private storage, because encrypted gene data are stored, only internal employees can access the data. Meanwhile, in semi-private storage, gene data are irreversibly modified by LDP. Through LDP, different noises are added to each section of the genomic data. Therefore, even though the third party uses or exposes the shared data, the owner’s privacy is guaranteed. Furthermore, the access control for each storage is ensured by the blockchain, and the gene owner can trace the usage and sharing status using a decentralized application in a mobile device. © 2021 by the authors.

The Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence are the foundations for innovative sustainable computing technologies in e-healthcare applications. In the IoT-enabled sustainable healthcare system, the IoT devices normally record the patient data and transfer it to the cloud for further processing. Security is considered an important issue in the design of IoT networks in the healthcare environment. To resolve this issue, this article presents a novel blockchain and artificial intelligence-enabled secure medical data transmission (BAISMDT) for IoT networks. The goal of the BAISMDT model is to achieve security and privacy in reliable data transmission of the IoT networks. The proposed model involves a signcryption technique for secure and reliable IoT data transmission. The blockchain-enabled secure medical data transmission process takes place among the IoT gadgets and service providers. The blockchain technique is applied to generate a viable environment to securely and reliably transmit data among different data providers. Next to the decryption process, the modified discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm with wavelet kernel extreme learning machine model is applied to determine the presence of disease. An extensive set of simulations were carried out on a benchmark medical dataset.

Due to recent laws and regulations (e.g, General Data Protection Regulation), PPRL approaches are increasingly demanded in real-world application areas such as health-care, credit analysis, public policy evaluation, and national security. However, the majority of the PPRL approaches consider an unrealistic adversary model, particularly the Honest but Curious (HBC) model, which assumes that all PPRL parties will follow a pre-agreed data integration protocol, and will not try to break the confidentiality of the data handled during the process. The HBC model is hard to employ in real-world applications, mainly because of the need to trust other parties fully. To overcome the limitations associated with the majority of the adversary models considered by PPRL approaches, we propose a protocol that considers covert adversaries, i.e., adversaries that may deviate arbitrarily from the protocol specification in an attempt to cheat. In such protocol, however, the honest parties are able to detect this misbehavior with a high probability. To provide a proof-of-concept implementation of this protocol, we employ the Blockchain technology and propose an improvement in the most used anonymization technique for PPRL, the Bloom Filter. The evaluation carried out using several real-world data sources has demonstrated the effectiveness (linkage quality) obtained by our contributions, as well as the ability to detect the misbehavior of a malicious adversary during the PPRL execution. © 2021","Blockchain; Bloom Filter; Data privacy; Entity resolution; Privacy preserving entity resolution","Blockchain; National security; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Privacy by design; Quality control; Adversary modeling; General data protection regulations; High probability; Laws and regulations; Malicious adversaries; Policy evaluation; Privacy preserving record linkages; Protocol specifications; Data integration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108270526

A large number of sensors and machinery are connected, and combined with the Internet, to achieve intelligent management and operation. However, the traditional centralized IoT data management solution inevitably encounters challenges of data trust, security, sustainability, and user privacy is difficult to guarantee. This paper takes the intelligent transportation sensor network as an example and proposes a blockchain-based Internet of Vehicles (IoV) data secure sharing scheme (called IoVChain), which implements automatic registration, rapid authentication, and reliable sharing method of IoV data through smart contract. The smart contract performs homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proof processing on the sensitive part of the data, and this part exists in the form of ciphertext on the blockchain. We adopt PBFT consensus mechanism to ensure the consistency of the entire network ledger, and all the IoV data processing and usage procedure is stored in the Merkle-tree-based block, which cannot be tampered with. Compared with the centralized IoV data management solution, the IoVChain scheme avoids the risk of single point of failure, and keeps the IoV data credible, available, and tamper-resistant under the premise of privacy and security, so that the data can be traced when needed. We have implemented the IoVChain scheme based on the consortium blockchain for trusted and secure sharing of IoV data. Finally, analysis and evaluation show that the proposed IoVChain scheme is feasible, safe, and extensible for the secure sharing of IoV data. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Blockchain; Internet of Things; privacy protection; trusted data sharing","Blockchain; Cryptography; Data privacy; Information management; Internet of things; Machinery; Network security; Sensor networks; Trees (mathematics); Vehicle to vehicle communications; Analysis and evaluation; Automatic registration; Data management solution; Ho-momorphic encryptions; Intelligent management; Intelligent transportation; Internet of thing (IOT); Privacy and security; Data Sharing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098758741

Cloud computing is unreliable, using it can compromise user privacy, and data may be leaked. Because cloud‐data and grid infrastructure are both growing exponentially, there is an urgent need to explore computational sources and cloud large‐data protection. Numerous cloud service categories are assimilated into numerous fields, such as defense systems and pharmaceutical databases, to compute information space and allocation of resources. Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) is a sophisticated approach which can permit employees to specify a higher level of security for data stored in cloud storage facilities. Numerous obsolete ABE techniques are practical when applied to small data sets to generate cryptograms with restricted computational properties; their properties are used to generate the key, encrypt it, and decrypt it. To address the current concerns, a dynamic non‐linear polynomial chaotic quantum hash technique on top of secure block chain model can be used for enhancing cloud data security while maintaining user privacy. In the proposed method, customer attributes are guaranteed by using a dynamic non‐ polynomial chaotic map function for the key initialization, encryption, and decryption. In the proposed model, both organized and unorganized massive clinical data are considered to be inputs for reliable corroboration and encoding.

Obviously, finding out how to safely store such a large amount of data is a problem that urgently needs to be solved. Additionally, the particularity of medical data makes it necessarily subject to great privacy protection needs. This reinforces the importance of designing a safe solution to ensure data privacy. Many existing schemes are based on single-server architecture, which have some natural defects (such as single-point faults). Although blockchain can help solve such problems, there are still some deficiencies in privacy protection. To solve these problems, this paper designs a medical data privacy protection system, which integrates blockchain, group signa-ture, and asymmetric encryption to realize reliable medical data sharing between medical institu-tions and protect the data privacy of patients. This paper proves theoretically that it meets our security and privacy requirements, and proves its practicability through system implementation. © 2021 by the authors.

Furthermore, the scope and scale of government data to be shared among departments is unclear, as the purposes for retrieving shared data are dynamically changing. In order to solve these problems, we propose a Service-On-Chain (or simply, SOC) approach.

Recently, blockchain-based eHealth systems have achieved great success in terms of EMRs sharing and management, but there still remain some challenges. Permissioned blockchain-based solutions provide high throughput and scalability, but may suffer from rollback attacks and lead to privacy leakage. Designs based on the public blockchain, on the other hand, are more open and secure, but sacrifice scalability and have no incentives for medical institutions to join into the systems. Moreover, data retrieval in blockchain-based eHealth systems is inefficient because of the basic blockchain structure. To solve the above problems, we propose a blockchain-based medical data sharing and privacy-preserving eHealth system named SPChain. To achieve quick retrieval, we devise special keyblocks and microblocks for patients to store their EMRs. A reputation system is also constructed to motivate medical institutions to participate in SPChain. By using proxy re-encryption schemes, SPChain achieves medical data sharing for patients in a privacy-preserving manner. To evaluate SPChain, we leverage the distribution of miners in the real world to test the system's performance and ability to resist mentioned attacks.

However, most of the data aggregation schemes ignore the data security and privacy protection issues of the edge layer. To solve these problems, in this article, we propose an edge blockchain assisted lightweight privacy-preserving data aggregation for smart grid, named EBDA. In this work, we integrate edge computing and blockchain to design a three-layer architecture data aggregation scheme for smart grid. This new architecture supports a two-level data aggregation scheme, which is more efficient and secure. Through theoretical analysis and simulations, EBDA shows great superiority in terms of resisting network attacks, reducing system computation costs and communication overhead compared with existing schemes. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","blockchain; data aggregation; Edge computing; smart grid","Blockchain; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Electric power transmission networks; Network architecture; Privacy by design; Sensor nodes; Analysis and simulation; Communication overheads; Computation costs; Data security and privacy; Privacy preserving; Reducing systems; Threelayer architecture; Traditional power system; Smart power grids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099080580

However, a large amount of IoT data is sensitive, and the leakage of such data is a privacy breach. The security of sensitive IoT data is a big issue, as the data is shared over an insecure network channel. Current solutions include symmetric encryption and access controls to secure the data transfer, but they have some drawbacks such as a single point of failure. Blockchain is a promising distributed ledger technology that can prevent the malicious tampering of data, offering reliable data storage. This paper proposes a distributed access control system based on blockchain technology to secure IoT data. The proposed mechanism is based on fog computing and the concept of the alliance chain. This method uses mixed linear and nonlinear spatiotemporal chaotic systems (MLNCML) and the least significant bit (LSB) to encrypt the IoT data on an edge node and then upload the encrypted data to the cloud. The proposed mechanism can solve the problem of a single point of failure of access control by providing the dynamic and fine-grained access control for IoT data. The experimental results of this method demonstrated that it can protect the privacy of IoT data efficiently. © 2020, The Author(s).","Access control; Blockchain; Cloud storage; Data privacy; IoT","Access control; Blockchain; Chaotic systems; Cryptography; Data privacy; Data transfer; Digital storage; Fog computing; Network security; Distributed access controls; Insecure networks; Internet of thing (IOT); Least significant bits; Privacy breaches; Privacy protection; Spatiotemporal chaotic systems; Symmetric encryption; Internet of things",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092670092

In this environment, surrounded by technologies, data, and personal information, have become an essential and coveted tool for many sectors. In this scenario, where a large amount of data has been collected, stored, and shared, privacy concerns arise, especially when dealing with sensitive data such as health data. The information owner generally has no control over his information, which can bring serious consequences such as increases in health insurance prices or put the individual in an uncomfortable situation with disclosing his physical or mental health. While privacy regulations, like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), make it clear that the information owner must have full control and management over their data, disparities have been observed in most systems and platforms. Therefore, they are often not able to give consent or have control and management over their data. For the users to exercise their right to privacy and have sufficient control over their data, they must know everything that happens to them, where their data is, and where they have been. It is necessary that the entire life cycle, from generation to deletion of data, is managed by its owner. To this end, this article presents an Information Chain of Custody Model based on Blockchain technology, which allows from the traceability of information to the offer of tools that will enable the effective management of data, offering total control to its owner.

Off-Chain Blockchain Systems (OCBS) enable this information processing and management through distributed software architecture where the blockchain network interacts with off-chain resources. Hence, OCBS are a critical data governance component in the design of enterprise blockchain solutions, resulting in extensive research and development exploring the interplay between on-chain and off-chain storage and computation and efforts to evaluate their performance relative to other information management systems. Key features of OCBS’ are their ability to improve scalability, reduce data storage requirements, and enhance data privacy, all extremely critical issues to enable broader blockchain adoption. These OCBS features map well to the needs of the healthcare industry, particularly due to the need to manage various types of medical, consumer, and other health-related data. However, different types of health data are also subject to stringent regulatory, security and legal requirements, a key factor limiting blockchain adoption in the sector.

By mid-decade, with full country wide deployment, there will be almost 1.3 billion smart meters in place \citeinfo. Collection of fine-grained energy usage data by these smart meters provides numerous advantages such as energy savings for customers with use of demand optimization, a billing system of higher accuracy with dynamic pricing programs, bidirectional information exchange ability between end-users for better consumer-operator interaction, and so on.

Sharing health data is considered a key way to improve the quality of health care services and reduce the cost of health care. However, nowadays, many people will create electronic health records in different hospitals. In the process of cross-hospital diagnosis, due to the decentralized storage of electronic medical record in various hospitals, the electronic health records cannot be shared. This phenomenon will cause obstacles to doctors' diagnosis, impede data sharing and endanger patient privacy. To solve these problems, we propose an EHRs privacy protection data sharing scheme based on blockchain. In this scheme, the original EHRs are securely stored in the cloud. The generated index is stored on the hospital private blockchain. Visitors can obtain the index of electronic health records through the blockchain. It's convenient to view the patient's electronical health records and diagnose the patient's condition in detail. In this way, the risk of medical data leakage can be greatly reduced. The advantages in the blockchain ensure that EHRs cannot be arbitrarily modified. Meanwhile, the original data is stored in the cloud, while the blockchain only stores indexes, which solves the problem of limited storage space in the blockchain. According to the current medical situation, we put forward Wanchain as a service (WaaS), and propose a cross-blockchain based privacy-preserving data sharing for electronic health records. Wanchain is used to achieve cross-blockchain secure access to EHRs data when patients visit different hospitals. In addition, our scheme ensures that patients can delete EHRs data effectively and freely. The safety and effectiveness of the system are proved through security analysis and performance evaluation. © 2021 IEEE.","cross-blockchain; electronic health records; privacy-preserving; WaaS","Advanced Analytics; Big data; Blockchain; Cloud computing; Diagnosis; Digital storage; Electronic document exchange; Health care; Hospitals; Medical computing; Privacy by design; Records management; Electronic health record; Electronic health record (EHRs); Electronic medical record; Patient privacies; Privacy preserving; Privacy protection; Quality of health care; Security analysis; Data Sharing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107645373

Consequently, blockchain-based IoT data aggregation may become a reasonable choice for the design of a privacy-preserving system. To this end, we propose PrivDA, a Privacy-preserving IoT Data Aggregation scheme based on the blockchain and homomorphic encryption technologies. In the proposed system, each data consumer can create a smart contract and publish both terms of service and requested IoT data. Thus, the smart contract puts together into one group potential data producers that can answer the consumer’s request and chooses one aggregator, the role of which is to compute the group requested result using homomorphic computations. Therefore, group-level aggregation obfuscates IoT data, which complicates sensitive information inference from a single IoT device.

K-anonymity is one of the most popular privacy protection solutions, in which the real location of the request vehicle (RV) can be covered by a cloaking area including the location of k-1 cooperative vehicles (CVs). However, K-anonymity assumes all CVs are always honest and thus offering opportunities for dishonest CVs to provide false location information. To combat such threats, we propose a trusted cloaking area construction (TCAC) scheme based on the trust mechanism to protect the location privacy of vehicles. In this article, the trust value is not only used to identify dishonest CVs, but also utilized to decide the LBS request of RV. A low trust value will make the LBS request be rejected due to dishonest and selfish cooperative behaviors when the RV has played the role of CV. To deal with the massive trust requirements caused by frequent vehicle movement, edge computing is employed to assist trust value evaluation. Moreover, traditional central and distributed trust data management may be unsuitable for vehicular networks.

However, ensuring security and privacy in the IoT context is a non-trivial task due to the low capability of these connected devices. Generally, the IoT device management is based on a centralized entity that validates communication and connection rights. Therefore, this centralized entity can be considered as a single point of failure. Yet, in the case of distributed approaches, it is difficult to delegate the right validation to IoT devices themselves in untrustworthy IoT environments. Fortunately, the blockchain may provide decentralization of overcoming the trust problem while designing a privacy-preserving system. To this end, we propose a novel privacy-preserving IoT device management framework based on the blockchain technology. In the proposed system, the IoT devices are controlled by several smart contracts that validate the connection rights according to the privacy permission settings predefined by the data owners and the stored record array of detected misbehavior of each IoT device. In fact, smart contracts can immediately detect the devices that have vulnerabilities and have been hacked or pose a threat to the IoT network. Therefore, the data owner's privacy is preserved by enforcing the control over the own devices. For validation purposes, we deploy the proposed solution on a private Ethereum blockchain and give the performance evaluation. © 2021 ACM.","Behavior control; blockchain; Internet of Things; smart contract","Blockchain; Privacy by design; Behavior control; Device management; Distributed approaches; Internet of thing (IOT); Non-trivial tasks; Privacy preserving; Quality of life; Security and privacy; Internet of things",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101664692

Based on this, in this paper, a secure multi-party computation protocol is designed based on the Pedersen commitment and Schnorr protocol (protocol of blockchain based on Pedersen commitment linked schnorr protocol for multi-party computation, BPLSM). Through constructing the structure of the protocol and carrying out formal proof calculations, it is confirmed that the protocol can be integrated into the blockchain network to merge different private messages for efficient signing under anonymity. In addition, by analyzing the nature and security of the protocol, it can be proved that the overhead about computation of the general-purpose privacy computing scheme using the BPLSM protocol on the blockchain is low, and it also has strong information imperceptibility. In the end, experimental simulation results show that the time cost of BPLSM protocol verification in a small-scale multi-party transaction with a fixed number of people is about 83.5% lower than that of the current mainstream BLS signature. © 2021, Science Press.

Although attribute-based keyword search (ABKS) is a well-received solution to the challenge, there are still privacy and efficiency issues if the traditional ABKS schemes are directly used in blockchain data sharing.

In the Internet era, privacy is strongly linked to data protection. “Data Protection” as such is nowhere defined; yet it can be understood as the protection of personal information from over exploitation. The right to the protection of personal data has not yet been treated as a fundamental right in some jurisdictions. In the European Union, data protection enjoyed protection as a fundamental right. The General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter the Regulation) inspired the people to claim legal protection of personal data. In the present digital world, data can represent a natural person.

As compared to public blockchain and private blockchain, consortium blockchain is widely used across different industries and use cases due to its privacy-preserving ability, auditability and high transaction rate. However, the present co-audit of privacy-preserving data on consortium blockchain is inefficient. Private data is usually encrypted by a session key before being published on a consortium blockchain for privacy preservation. The session key is shared with transaction parties and auditors for their access. For decentralizing auditorial power, multiple auditors on the consortium blockchain jointly undertake the responsibility of auditing. The distribution of the session key to an auditor requires individually encrypting the session key with the public key of the auditor. The transaction initiator needs to be online when each auditor asks for the session key, and one encryption of the session key for each auditor consumes resources. This work proposes GAChain and applies group key agreement technology to efficiently co-audit privacy-preserving data on consortium blockchain. Multiple auditors on the consortium blockchain form a group and utilize the blockchain to generate a shared group encryption key and their respective group decryption keys. The session key is encrypted only once by the group encryption key and stored on the consortium blockchain together with the encrypted private data. Auditors then obtain the encrypted session key from the chain and decrypt it with their respective group decryption key for co-auditing. The group key generation is involved only when the group forms or group membership changes, which happens very infrequently on the consortium blockchain. We implement the prototype of GAChain based on Hyperledger Fabric framework. Our experimental studies demonstrate that GAChain improves the co-audit efficiency of transactions containing private data on Fabric, and its incurred overhead is moderate. © 2021 IEEE.","co-audit; Consortium blockchain; group key agreement; privacy preservation","Digital storage; Distributed ledger; Privacy-preserving techniques; Block-chain; Co-audit; Consortium blockchain; Decryption keys; Encryption key; Group key agreement; Privacy preservation; Privacy preserving; Private data; Session key; Blockchain",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128761178

It enables vehicles to exchange vehicular data (e.g., GPS, sensors, and brakes) with different entities nearby. However, sharing these vehicular data over the air raises concerns about identity privacy leakage. Besides, the centralized architecture adopted in existing IoV systems is fragile to single point of failure and malicious attacks. With the emergence of blockchain technology, it has the chance to solve these problems due to its features of tamper-proof, traceability and decentralization.

At the same time, it becomes a great concern that how to obtain optimal outputs from big data publishing and sharing management while protecting privacy. Many researchers seek to realize differential privacy protection in massive high-dimensional datasets using the method of principal component analysis. However, these algorithms are inefficient in processing and do not take into account the different privacy protection needs of each attribute in high-dimensional datasets. To address the above problem, we design a Divided-block Sparse Matrix Transformation Differential Privacy Data Publishing Algorithm (DSMT-DP). In this algorithm, different levels of privacy budget parameters are assigned to different attributes according to the required privacy protection level of each attribute, taking into account the privacy protection needs of different levels of attributes. Meanwhile, the use of the divided-block scheme and the sparse matrix transformation scheme can improve the computational efficiency of the principal component analysis method for handling large amounts of high-dimensional sensitive data, and we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm satisfies differential privacy. Our experimental results show that the mean square error of the proposed algorithm is smaller than the traditional differential privacy algorithm with the same privacy parameters, and the computational efficiency can be improved. Further, we combine this algorithm with blockchain and propose an Efficient Privacy Data Publishing and Sharing Model based on the blockchain. Publishing and sharing private data on this model not only resist strong background knowledge attacks from adversaries outside the system but also prevent stealing and tampering of data by not-completely-honest participants inside the system. © 2021 Yiyang Hong et al.",,"Blockchain; Data privacy; Efficiency; Large dataset; Linear transformations; Matrix algebra; Mean square error; Metadata; Parameter estimation; Principal component analysis; Block sparse; Block-chain; Data publishing; Data Sharing; Differential privacies; High-dimensional dataset; Matrix transformation; Principal-component analysis; Privacy protection; Sparse matrices; Computational efficiency",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122259631

Therefore, we propose a supervisable energy transaction data privacy protection scheme, which aims to trade off the supervision of energy transaction data by the supervisory authority and the privacy protection of transaction data. First, the concealment of the transaction amount is realized by Pedersen commitment and Bulletproof range proof.

By integrating with blockchain technology, we could extend the model's capabilities by presenting transparency in logic execution and integrity in data storage. Despite these advantages, blockchain brings in new challenges regarding system performance and data privacy. Due to distributed nature of blockchain, any new updating request needs to be reflected in all network's peers before proceeding to the subsequence requests. This process produces delay and possibility in request rejection due to update conflict. In addition, data removal is no longer feasible since each record is protected by immutable hashed link. To overcome these limitations, the integration model of blockchain and message queue is proposed in this paper.

However, the poor implementation of access control of educational data produced by the IoT devices has brought students' and teachers' privacy into danger. Attackers can access educational data that they are not permitted to access and even erase the records during access. To tackle this problem, we employ blockchain technology to guarantee the integrity of access control rules and trace the records of access events. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based access control scheme for the data produced by IoT devices. The scheme consists of three components: (1) a well-implemented data collection module that is deployed in smart classrooms, which collects and uploads data about the real-time situation inside the smart classroom to the data center; (2) a MongoDB-based data center and its control module that makes access control decisions based on the verification of the permissions of visitors, where the permissions are managed by blockchain; and (3) a customized blockchain system that stores and keeps security policy updates of the role-based access control module and records access events in a trusted way. Our analysis indicates that the proposed access control scheme guarantees the correctness of the access control process and makes the access of collected educational data auditable and responsible. Our system collectively analyzes the context of the smart classroom and is capable of detecting multiple scenarios such as absence, lateness, and gunshot.

Meanwhile, the health-related mobile apps and devices also generate a large amount of medical data, which is critical for promoting disease research and diagnosis. However, medical data is too sensitive to share, which is also a common issue for IoT (Internet of Things) data. The traditional centralized cloud-based medical data sharing schemes have to rely on a single trusted third party. Therefore, the schemes suffer from single-point failure and lack of privacy protection and access control for the data. Blockchain is an emerging technique to provide an approach for managing data in a decentralized manner. Especially, the blockchain-based smart contract technique enables the programmability for participants to access the data. All the interactions are authenticated and recorded by the other participants of the blockchain network, which is tamper resistant. In this paper, we leverage the K-anonymity and searchable encryption techniques and propose a blockchain-based privacy-preserving scheme for medical data sharing among medical institutions and data users. To be specific, the consortium blockchain, Hyperledger Fabric, is adopted to allow data users to search for encrypted medical data records. The smart contract, i.e., the chaincode, implements the attribute-based access control mechanisms to guarantee that the data can only be accessed by the user with proper attributes. The K-anonymity and searchable encryption ensure that the medical data is shared without privacy leaking, i.e., figuring out an individual patient from queries. We implement a prototype system using the chaincode of Hyperledger Fabric. From the functional perspective, security analysis shows that the proposed scheme satisfies security goals and precedes others. From the performance perspective, we conduct experiments by simulating different numbers of medical institutions.

Similarly, blockchain uses the same approach by providing a digital ledger that can cover the flaws in the centralised system. Motivated by the merits of a decentralised approach, we construct a collaborative model of simultaneous distributed learning by employing multiple computing devices over shared memory with blockchain smart contracts as a secure incentive mechanism.

To solve this problem, we propose a framework consisting of middleware of external source server, data prover, and verification contract. The framework converts the data signed in the web server into a proof that the owner can prove with zk-SNARKs and provides a smart contract that can verify this. Through these procedures, data owners not only protect their privacy by proving themselves, but they can also automate on-chain processing through smart contract verification.

Recently, blockchain has gained extensive attention with its prominent characteristics as public, distributed, decentration and chronological characteristics. However, the transaction information on the blockchain is open to all nodes, the transaction information update operation is even more transparent. And the leakage of transaction information will cause huge losses to the transaction party. In response to these problems, this paper combines hierarchical attribute encryption with linear secret sharing, and proposes a blockchain data privacy protection control scheme based on searchable attribute encryption, which solves the privacy exposure problem in traditional blockchain transactions. The user's access control is implemented by the verification nodes, which avoids the security risks of submitting private keys and access structures to the blockchain network. Associating the private key component with the random identity of the user node in the blockchain can solve the collusion problem. In addition, authorized users can quickly search and supervise transaction information through searchable encryption. The improved algorithm ensures the security of keywords.

Blockchain is a technology that provides such a data repository. However, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) assumed a centralized data repository, and it is commonly argued that blockchain technology is not usable. This paper aims to posit a framework for adopting a blockchain that follows the GDPR. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses the Levy and Ellis’ narrative review of literature methodology, which is based on constructivist theory posited by Lincoln and Guba. Using five information systems and computer science databases, the researchers searched for studies using the keywords GDPR and blockchain, using a forward and backward search technique. The search identified a corpus of 416 candidate studies, from which the researchers applied pre-established criteria to select 39 studies. The researchers mined this corpus for concepts, which they clustered into themes. Using the accepted computer science practice of privacy by design, the researchers combined the clustered themes into the paper’s posited framework. Findings: The paper posits a framework that provides architectural tactics for designing a blockchain that follows GDPR to enhance privacy. The framework explicitly addresses the challenges of GDPR compliance using the unimagined decentralized storage of personal data. The framework addresses the blockchain–GDPR tension by establishing trust between a business and its customers vis-à-vis storing customers’ data. The trust is established through blockchain’s capability of providing the customer with private keys and control over their data, e.g. processing and access. Research limitations/implications: The paper provides a framework that demonstrates that blockchain technology can be designed for use in GDPR compliant solutions. In using the framework, a blockchain-based solution provides the ability to audit and monitor privacy measures, demonstrates a legal justification for processing activities, incorporates a data privacy policy, provides a map for data processing and ensures security and privacy awareness among all actors. The research is limited to a focus on blockchain–GDPR compliance; however, future research is needed to investigate the use of the framework in specific domains. Practical implications: The paper posits a framework that identifies the strategies and tactics necessary for GDPR compliance. Practitioners need to compliment the framework with rigorous privacy risk management, i.e. conducting a privacy risk analysis, identifying strategies and tactics to address such risks and preparing a privacy impact assessment that enhances accountability and transparency of a blockchain. Originality/value: With the increasingly strategic use of data by businesses and the contravening growth of data privacy regulation, alternative technologies could provide businesses with a means to nurture trust with its customers regarding collected data. However, it is commonly assumed that the decentralized approach of blockchain technology cannot be applied to this business need. This paper posits a framework that enables a blockchain to be designed that follows the GDPR; thereby, providing an alternative for businesses to collect customers’ data while ensuring the customers’ trust. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Blockchain; GDPR; Privacy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096537200

Most of the existing solutions assume that the classifier’s training data can be obtained securely from different IoT data providers. The primary concern is data privacy when training a K-Nearest Neighbour (K-NN) classifier with IoT data from various entities. This paper proposes secure K-NN, which provides a privacy-preserving K-NN training over IoT data. It employs Blockchain technology with a partial homomorphic cryptosystem (PHC) known as Paillier in order to protect all participants (i.e., IoT data analyst C and IoT data provider P) data privacy. When C analyzes the IoT data of P, both participants’ privacy issue arises and requires a trusted third party. To protect each candidate’s privacy and remove the dependency on a third-party, we assemble secure building blocks in secure K-NN based on Blockchain technology. Firstly, a protected data-sharing platform is developed among various P, where encrypted IoT data is registered on a shared ledger. Secondly, the secure polynomial operation (SPO), secure biasing operations (SBO), and secure comparison (SC) are designed using the homomorphic property of Paillier. It shows that secure K-NN does not need any trusted third-party at the time of interaction, and rigorous security analysis demonstrates that secure K-NN protects sensitive data privacy for each P and C. The secure K-NN achieved 97.84%, 82.33%, and 76.33% precisions on BCWD, HDD, and DD datasets. The performance of secure K-NN is precisely similar to the general K-NN and outperforms all the previous state of art methods. © 2020 by the authors.

The data is later stored in an Ethereum based public blockchain to enable seamless BCT transactions. This system uses the Ganache platform for BCT that ensures data protection and privacy. Furthermore, metamask wallet for Ethbalance is required to perform transactions over BCT. The proposed methodology thus helps to protect data from stalkers, plaintext attacks as well as ciphertext attacks.

Distributed knowledge discovery techniques have been proposed which assume the cooperation of data owners even though they might not behave in a trustworthy manner. When a party decides to quit the cooperation in the distributed knowledge discovery, the other parties cannot continue the discovery task and hence they get some disadvantage due to the party’s betrayal. This paper is concerned with data privacy-preserving distributed knowledge discovery which gives penalty to the party who quits the cooperation in the discovery process. It proposes a blockchain-based distributed machine learning method which does not disclose the participating parties’ data and gives the penalty to betraying parties. The proposed method makes the participating parties communicate with each other via the smart contract on the blockchain network.

In 2016, a large-scale DDoS attack, named Dyn, caused massive damage to several well-known companies. One effective countermeasure is observing previous network traffic information or abnormal behavior determined by the host machines and determining the latest DDoS-attack IP addresses. Because of the lack of a fair exchange mechanism, most security operation centers (SOCs) are unwilling to share their real-time DDoS data. In this article, we propose a decentralized DDoS data exchange platform, namely SOChain, using blockchain technology to overcome the trust and fairness issues. The platform incentivizes SOCs through the DDoS_coin token. The more DDoS information an SOC contributes, the more coins it earns. To confirm the validity of uploaded information, we enlist a content verifier to examine uploaded abnormal IP addresses. Moreover, the verifier is incentivized by the DDoS_coin.

Smart meters face serious security challenges, such as a trusted third party or a trusted authority being attacked, which leads to the disclosure of user privacy. Blockchain provides a viable solution that can use its key technologies to solve this problem. Blockchain is a new type of decentralized protocol that does not require a trusted third party or a central authority. Therefore, this paper proposes a decentralized privacy-preserving data aggregation (DPPDA) scheme for smart grid based on blockchain. In this scheme, the leader election algorithm is used to select a smart meter in the residential area as a mining node to build a block. The node adopts Paillier cryptosystem algorithm to aggregate the user’s power consumption data. Boneh-Lynn-Shacham short signature and SHA-256 function are applied to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of user data, which is convenient for billing and power regulation. The scheme protects user privacy data while achieving decentralization, without relying on TTP or CA.

The authentication and verification of digital identity is essential to achieve the privacy and security of distributed digital identities. In this paper, we provide a coherent view of the central concepts of self-sovereign Identity, including the components of identity proofing and authentication solutions for different self-sovereign Identity solutions. We discussed an overview of Identity management approaches, introducing an architecture overview as well as the relevant actors in such a system and blockchain technology as solution for distributed user-centric identity. Finally, we discuss the existing solutions and point out the research gaps and elaborate challenges and trade-offs towards building a complete identity management system. © 2020 IEEE.","authentication mechanism; Blockchain; claim verification; Identity proofing; Self-sovereign Identity","Authentication; Blockchain; Data privacy; Digital devices; Economic and social effects; Authentication solutions; Digital identity; Digital revolution; Identity management; Identity management systems; Privacy and security; Service provider; User-centric identity; Electronic document identification systems",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095593342

The VANET has been used to improve driving safety and construct an ITS in modern cities. However, owing to the wireless characteristics, the message transmitted through the network can be observed, altered, or forged. Since driving safety is a major part of VANET, the security and privacy of these messages must be preserved. Therefore, this paper introduces an efficient privacy-preserving data transmission architecture that makes use of blockchain technology in cluster-based VANET. The cluster-based VANET architecture is used to achieve load balancing and minimize overhead in the network, where the clustering process is performed using the rainfall optimization algorithm (ROA). The ROA-based clustering with blockchain-based data transmission, called a ROAC-B technique, initially clusters the vehicles, and communication takes place via blockchain technology. A sequence of experiments was conducted to ensure the superiority of the ROAC-B technique, and several aspects of the results were considered. The simulation outcome showed that the ROAC-B technique is superior to other techniques in terms of packet delivery ratio (PDR), end to end (ETE) delay, throughput, and cluster size. © 2020 by the authors.

A blockchain as a continuously growing list of records managed by a peer-to-peer network is widely used in various application scenarios; and it is commonly agreed that the blockchain technology can improve the protection of financial data privacy. However, current blockchain technology still poses some challenges in fully meeting the needs of financial data privacy protection. In order to address the existing problems, this paper proposes a new data privacy management framework based on the blockchain technology for the financial sector. The framework consists of three components: (1) a data privacy classification method according to the characteristics of financial data; (2) a new collaborative-filtering-based model; and (3) a data disclosure confirmation scheme for customer strategies based on the Nudge Theory.

In this view, this paper presents a new privacy-preserving Secure Ant Colony optimization with Multi Kernel Support Vector Machine (ACOMKSVM) with Elliptical Curve cryptosystem (ECC) for secure and reliable IoT data sharing. This program uses blockchain to ensure protection and integrity of some data while it has the technology to create secure ACOMKSVM training algorithms in partial views of IoT data, collected from various data providers. Then, ECC is used to create effective and accurate privacy that protects ACOMKSVM secure learning process. In this study, the authors deployed blockchain technique to create a secure and reliable data exchange platform across multiple data providers, where IoT data is encrypted and recorded in a distributed ledger. The security analysis showed that the specific data ensures confidentiality of critical data from each data provider and protects the parameters of the ACOMKSVM model for data analysts.

But here the question of trust arises as the data will go through many phases for the analysis by different parties. The data may contain some sensitive or private information that can be miss utilized by the organizations involved in the analysis stages. So it is needed for the hour to consider the data privacy issues very seriously. Data privacy refers to how to control the use of a piece of data by its relative importance. For example, someone will not hesitate to say his/her name to strangers but will not share mobile no. address until the stranger becomes familiar. In this digital age, the personal use of data privacy generally applied to critical personal information. From a business point of view, data privacy operates in a broader sense beyond the critical information of employees customers. There is a general conclusion that AI Machine Learning driven technologies are obstructed by data privacy issues as the ML uses large data sets to train test. But can the obstacle block convert to a stepping stone? Yes, It can be. Imagine a scenario where no one is trust-able, so in that case, Blockchain enters the scene.

Despite the advantages, users must rely on storage services for data confidentiality, data access control, user privacy, and data availability. Whereas data confidentiality can be protected by advanced encryption algorithms, the rest remain challenging. First, in existing centralized storage services, even though data access controls are mainly defined by data owners, they are maintained and enforced by the services, which can deny data retrieval requests of authorized users or allow requests of illegitimate users. Second, the identity of a user is often known to the services to verify its eligibility to access requested data according to the access control, thus making the user traceable in the system. More importantly, the lack of anonymity may make users reluctant to use such services in sensitive contexts. Third, a huge amount of data is daily generated and stored on a centralized party, simultaneously serving requests from many users, which may cause a collapse of the system during peak periods. To address all these concerns, we propose a privacy-preserving blockchain-based data sharing platform for the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a content-addressable peer-to-peer storage system.

The traditional centralized processing method adopts centralized transmission and storage of users’ data privacy, which improves the security and reliability of processing. The non central blockchain technology uses distributed ledger technology to realize the characteristics of disintermediation, data tampering, traceability, work audit, etc. encryption algorithm is used to encrypt the data, and consensus mechanism makes the data sharing of blockchain system more fair and stable. The current passive data privacy schemes are basically based on cryptography. On the premise of satisfying the constraint mechanism of blockchain, this paper studies the technical framework, encryption mechanism and empirical analysis of blockchain, and discusses the information privacy protection method of hiding the original big data as much as possible, so as to improve the system performance and protect the security and privacy of user data. At the same time, we study data privacy protection from the perspective of software architecture, and propose a data privacy protection scheme through algorithm decomposition multi center collaboration method, which provides guidance for big data sharing and transaction based on blockchain. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Blockchain technology architecture; Cryptographic hash function; Cryptography; Privacy protection; Software architecture","Big data; Blockchain; Cryptography; Digital storage; Privacy by design; Processing; Software architecture; Centralized processing; Constraint mechanism; Data privacy protections; Encryption algorithms; Information privacy; Security and privacy; Security and reliabilities; Technical frameworks; Data Sharing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097204481

However, electronic medical data are stored in isolated data silos within each hospital due to the privacy and competition. Because of the complex interests of various groups, there is a lack of data flow between medical entities. On the one hand, this leads to difficulties for patients to obtain their own electronic medical data and to referral between different hospitals. On the other hand, it has led to serious lack of actual data for medical researchers. The realization of the determination of medical data ownership is the first condition for realizing medical data circulation. How to retrieve the required medical data while protecting privacy is the second problem to be solved. In this paper, we design the medical metadata as the smallest subunit of data ownership confirmation and propose a blockchain-based medical data sharing Framework MDSF, which can be used for electronic medical data ownership confirmation and data search while protecting patient privacy. We use the petri nets to verify the system and prove its reachability and boundedness, which means it can realize its designed function and operate safely. The system provides users with a convenient and safe way to obtain their past medical data, also enables research institutions engaged in medical data mining to easily search and obtain the actual medical data needed after desensitization. Thereby the circulation of medical data between different hospitals, individuals and research institutions is realized. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Blockchain; Data ownership confirmation; Data search; Electronic medical data; Petri nets","Blockchain; Data mining; Data Sharing; Hospitals; Petri nets; Privacy by design; Search engines; Data mining technology; Data ownership; Data searches; Medical data mining; Medical researchers; Patient privacies; Reachability; Research institutions; Medical computing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097176162

In recent years, a large number of privacy-preservation data aggregation schemes have been proposed for smart grid, which relies on trusted third party (TTP) or central authority (CA). If the TTP or CA fails, these schemes become insecure. Therefore, this paper proposes a smart grid data aggregation scheme based on blockchain, which does not rely on TTP or CA and achieves decentralization. In this scheme, the leader election algorithm is used to select a smart meter in the residential area as a mining node to build a block. The node adopts Paillier cryptosystem algorithm to aggregate the user’s electricity consumption data. The confidentiality and integrity of user data are guaranteed, which is convenient for billing and power regulation. Security analysis shows that our scheme meets the security and privacy requirements of smart grid data aggregation. The experimental results show that this scheme is more efficient than existing competing schemes in terms of computation and communication overhead. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Blockchain; Data aggregation; Decentralizing; Privacy-preservation","Blockchain; Electric power transmission networks; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Privacy by design; Communication overheads; Electricity-consumption; Leader election algorithm; Paillier cryptosystem; Privacy preservation; Privacy preserving; Security and privacy; Trusted third parties; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096578679

Each part is encrypted with a symmetric encryption key and it is broadcast encrypted to a pre-defined user set. Data encryption keys are generated by a key regression scheme, where keys used to encrypt low-sensitivity data parts can be derived from keys used to encrypt high-sensitivity data parts.

However, it has a problem in ensuring the privacy of user data due to its public nature. Data on a blockchain is public and can reveal someone’s personal data or transactions. Many applications that venture in blockchain such as financial applications, Internet of Things (IoT) and healthcare applications can fall victim to revelation of personal data and linking attack. Many solutions such as automated access-control protocol that does not require a third party, a local miner operating in a local private blockchain that enforces users’ access control policy, a cryptographic protocol that lets contractual parties interact by using zero-knowledge proof, and computation of data query in a distributed way by using secure multi-party computation have been proposed to tackle this privacy issue in using blockchain. Hence, this paper provides a review on the current solutions that addresses the privacy issues of blockchain in different platforms.

However, the data collected and processed by IoT systems especially the ones with centralized control are vulnerable to availability, integrity, and privacy threats. Hence, we present “PrivySharing,” a blockchain-based innovative framework for privacy-preserving and secure IoT data sharing in a smart city environment. The proposed scheme is distinct from existing strategies on many aspects. The data privacy is preserved by dividing the blockchain network into various channels, where every channel comprises a finite number of authorized organizations and processes a specific type of data such as health, smart car, smart energy or financial details. Moreover, access to users’ data within a channel is controlled by embedding access control rules in the smart contracts. In addition, data within a channel is further isolated and secured by using private data collection and encryption respectively. Likewise, the REST API that enables clients to interact with the blockchain network has dual security in the form of an API Key and OAuth 2.0. The proposed solution conforms to some of the significant requirements outlined in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. We also present a system of reward in the form of a digital token named “PrivyCoin” for users sharing their data with stakeholders/third parties.

However, due to the limited computing power and storage capacity of IoT devices, users' health data are generally stored in a centralized third party, such as the hospital database or cloud, and make users lose control of their health data, which can easily result in privacy leakage and single-point bottleneck. In this paper, we propose Healthchain, a large-scale health data privacy preserving scheme based on blockchain technology, where health data are encrypted to conduct fine-grained access control. Specifically, users can effectively revoke or add authorized doctors by leveraging user transactions for key management. Furthermore, by introducing Healthchain, both IoT data and doctor diagnosis cannot be deleted or tampered with so as to avoid medical disputes. Security analysis and experimental results show that the proposed Healthchain is applicable for smart healthcare system. © 2014 IEEE.","Blockchain; dynamic key management; fine-grained access control; Internet of Things (IoT); privacy preserving; smart healthcare","Access control; Blockchain; Data privacy; Diagnosis; Digital storage; Health care; Dynamic key managements; Fine grained; Internet of thing (IOT); Internet of Things (IOT); Privacy preserving; Remote monitoring; Security analysis; Smart healthcare systems; Internet of things",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073422904

As a typical ML model, support vector machine (SVM) enables efficient data classification and thereby finds its applications in real-world scenarios, such as disease diagnosis and anomaly detection. Training an SVM classifier usually requires a collection of labeled IoT data from multiple entities, raising great concerns about data privacy. Most of the existing solutions rely on an implicit assumption that the training data can be reliably collected from multiple data providers, which is often not the case in reality. To bridge the gap between ideal assumptions and realistic constraints, in this paper, we propose secureSVM, which is a privacy-preserving SVM training scheme over blockchain-based encrypted IoT data. We utilize the blockchain techniques to build a secure and reliable data sharing platform among multiple data providers, where IoT data is encrypted and then recorded on a distributed ledger. We design secure building blocks, such as secure polynomial multiplication and secure comparison, by employing a homomorphic cryptosystem, Paillier, and construct a secure SVM training algorithm, which requires only two interactions in a single iteration, with no need for a trusted third-party. Rigorous security analysis prove that the proposed scheme ensures the confidentiality of the sensitive data for each data provider as well as the SVM model parameters for data analysts. Extensive experiments demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed scheme. © 2014 IEEE.","Blockchain; encrypted Internet of Things (IoT) data; homomorphic cryptosystem (HC); machine learning (ML); privacy protection","Anomaly detection; Blockchain; Computer aided diagnosis; Cryptography; Data privacy; Iterative methods; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Smart city; Support vector machines; Data-sharing platforms; Homomorphic cryptosystem; Internet of Things (IOT); Polynomial multiplication; Privacy protection; Real-world scenario; Secure building blocks; Trusted third parties; Internet of things",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069186132

Yet, current solutions focus on single-keyword search over encrypted data on the blockchain. To extend such approaches to multi-keyword scenarios, they essentially perform a single-keyword search for multiple times and take the intersection of the results. However, such extensions suffer from privacy and efficiency issues. In particular, the service peers, which process the search requests, will be aware of the intermediate results, which include the data associated with each of the encrypted keywords. Moreover, these multiple traversals incur long delays in performing the search requests one after another with an extra cost in calculating the intersection of multiple sets. Finally, the service peers will charge the data owner a lot for writing the vast intermediate results to the smart contract. In this paper, we propose a bloom filter-enabled multi-keyword search protocol with enhanced efficiency as well as privacy preservation. In the protocol, a low-frequency keyword selected by a bloom filter will be used to filter the database when performing a multi-keyword search operation. Because the keyword is of low frequency, the majority of the data will be excluded from the result, which reduces the computational cost significantly. Moreover, we propose to use pseudorandom tags to facilitate completing each search operation in only one round. In this way, no intermediate results are generated, and the privacy is preserved. Finally, we implement the protocol in a local simulated blockchain network and conduct extensive experiments. The results indicate that our multi-keyword search protocol outperforms the traditional method with an average of 14.67% less time delay and 59.96% less financial cost. © 2019 IEEE.","Blockchain; Smart contract; Symmetric searchable encryption","Cryptography; Data structures; Digital storage; Efficiency; Multiprocessing systems; Search engines; Computational costs; Distributed storage system; Enhanced efficiency; Intermediate results; Privacy preservation; Privacy preserving; Recent researches; Searchable encryptions; Blockchain",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078694957

Therefore, this paper adopts blockchain technology to store data, which improves the security of the collected data. Moreover, a storage model based on blockchain in WBAN is proposed in our solution. However, blockchain storage brings new problems, for example, that the storage space of blockchain is small, and the stored content is open to unauthorized attackers. To solve the problems above, this paper proposed a sequential aggregate signature scheme with a designated verifier (DVSSA) to ensure that the user’s data can only be viewed by the designated person and to protect the privacy of the users of WBAN.

The integrity and availability of medical data are the basic guarantee for the smooth operation of these activities. The privacy of medical data is a natural demand from the sensitivity of medical data. At present, there are mainly two ways to protect the privacy of medical data. One way is to store medical data in a local database and set up an access control strategy of the database. The other way is to encrypt medical data with the patient’s key and to share the key when needed. The problem with the first method is that the data in the local database may be modified or deleted. The problem with the second method is that the key cannot be shared when the patient dies during the diagnosis and treatment. These two problems will damage the availability of data. This paper proposes to establish a shared key that could be reconstructed by the legitimate parties before the process of diagnosis and treatment begins. The data in the diagnosis and treatment process is encrypted and stored in a blockchain using the shared key. The proposal meets the integrity, availability and privacy requirements of medical data. It uses the sibling intractable function families (SIFF) to establish a shared key, and uses the Hyperledger Fabric to store encrypted data. The simulation shows that the system has good efficiency. Additionally, it is the first time to introduce SIFF to a blockchain application. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Availability; Blockchain; Integrity; Medical data; Privacy","accident; adult; article; control strategy; human; privacy; sibling; simulation; computer security; confidentiality; electronic health record; medical information system; organization and management; standards; Computer Security; Confidentiality; Electronic Health Records; Health Information Exchange; Humans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059493183

However, there are a number of limitations underpinning the use of blockchain, which limits its adoption particularly in applications that require low energy and computational footprints.

In fact, the adoption of smart products may depend on the ability of organizations to offer systems that ensure adequate sensor data integrity while guaranteeing sufficient user privacy. In light of these challenges, previous research indicates that blockchain technology could be a promising means to mitigate issues of data security arising in the IoT. Building upon the existing body of knowledge, we propose a design theory, including requirements, design principles, and features, for a blockchain-based sensor data protection system (SDPS) that leverages data certification. To support this, we designed and developed an instantiation of an SDPS (CertifiCar) in three iterative cycles intented to prevent the fraudulent manipulation of car mileage data. Following the explication of our SDPS, we provide an ex post evaluation of our design theory considering CertifiCar and two additional use cases in the areas of pharmaceutical supply chains and energy microgrids.

However, the data collected and processed by IoT systems especially the ones with centralized control are vulnerable to availability, integrity, and privacy threats. Hence, we present “PrivySharing,” a blockchain-based innovative framework for integrity and privacy-preserving IoT data sharing in a smart city environment. The proposed scheme is distinct from existing technologies on many aspects. The data privacy is preserved by dividing the blockchain network into various channels, where every channel processes a specific type of data such as health, smart car, smart energy or financial data. Moreover, access to user data within a channel is controlled by embedding access control rules in the smart contracts. In addition, users' data within a channel is further isolated and secured by using private data collection. Likewise, the REST API that enables clients to interact with the blockchain network has dual security in the form of an API Key and OAuth 2.0. The proposed solution also conforms to some of the significant requirements outlined in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. Lastly, we present a system of reward in the form of a digital token “PrivyCoin” for the users for sharing their data with the stakeholders/third parties.

In this paper, we propose a homomorphic consortium blockchain for SHS sensitive data privacy preserving (HCB-SDPP), which is based on the traditional smart home system. We add verification services, which are composed of verification nodes, to our model to verify working nodes and transactions in SHS. In order to record the SHS device information transaction, we propose a new block data structure based on homomorphic encryption (HEBDS). Using the HCB-SDPP model, we design an encrypted algorithm based on Paillier encrypted for privacy protection. To verify the validity of the HCB-SDPP model, we firstly encrypt sensitive data of all gateway peers and upload them to the consortium blockchain. Then, we validate the security of sensitive data after homomorphic encryption processing. In the experiment, we also design attack experiments to attack different types of peers on the consortium blockchain in the HCB-SDPP model. If these nodes are insecure, the influence on the whole model will be analyzed. The simulation result shows that the HCB-SDPP model can protect customer privacy more effectively than SHS. © 2013 IEEE.","consortium blockchain; homomorphic encryption; Privacy preserving; smart home systems","Automation; Blockchain; Cryptography; Solar buildings; Customer privacy; Device information; Encrypted algorithms; Ho-momorphic encryptions; Privacy preserving; Privacy protection; Sensitive datas; Smart-home system; Data privacy",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066789912

Data analytics has entered the field of education under the name of learning analytics. Data analytics can provide insights that can be used to enhance learning activities for educational stakeholders, as well as helping online learning applications providers to enhance their services. However, despite the goodwill in the use of Edtech, some service providers use it as a means to collect private data about the students for their own interests and benefits. This is showcased in recent cases seen in media of bad use of students’ personal information. This growth in cases is due to the recent tightening in data privacy regulations, especially in the EU. The students or their parents should be the owners of the information about them and their learning activities online. Thus they should have the right tools to control how their information is accessed and for what purposes. Currently, there is no technological solution to prevent leaks or the misuse of data about the students or their activity. It seems appropriate to try to solve it from an automation technology perspective. In this paper, we consider the use of Blockchain technologies as a possible basis for a solution to this problem.

Surveillance caused privacy breaching incidents have already questioned existing personal data collection techniques. Organizations assemble a huge amount of personally identifiable information (PII) for data-driven market analysis and prediction. However, the limitation of data tracking tools restricts the detection of exact data breaching points. Blockchain technology, an 'immutable' distributed ledger, can be leveraged to establish a transparent data auditing platform. However, Art. 42 and Art. 25 of general data protection regulation (GDPR) demands 'right to forget' and 'right to erase' of personal information, which goes against the immutability of blockchain technology. This paper proposes a GDPR complied decentralized and trusted PII sharing and tracking scheme. Proposed blockchain based personally identifiable information management system (BcPIIMS) demonstrates data movement among GDPR entities (user, controller and processor). Considering GDPR limitations, BcPIIMS used off-the-chain data storing architecture. A prototype was created to validate the proposed architecture using multichain. The use of off-the-chain storage reduces individual block size. Additionally, private blockchain also limits personal data leaking by collecting fast approval from restricted peers.

This work proposes a blockchain-based secure and privacy-preserving PHI sharing (BSPP) scheme for diagnosis improvements in e-Health systems. Firstly, two kinds of blockchains, private blockchain and consortium blockchain, are constructed by devising their data structures, and consensus mechanisms. The private blockchain is responsible for storing the PHI while the consortium blockchain keeps records of the secure indexes of the PHI. In order to achieve data security, access control, privacy preservation and secure search, all the data including the PHI, keywords and the patients’ identity are public key encrypted with keyword search. Furthermore, the block generators are required to provide proof of conformance for adding new blocks to the blockchains, which guarantees the system availability. Security analysis demonstrates that the proposed protocol can meet with the security goals.

As the scale of data sharing expands, its privacy protection has become a hot issue in research. Moreover, in data sharing, the data is usually maintained in multiple parties, which brings new challenges to protect the privacy of these multi-party data. In this paper, we propose a trusted data sharing scheme using blockchain. We use blockchain to prevent the shared data from being tampered, and use the Paillier cryptosystem to realize the confidentiality of the shared data.

On one side the general availability of the data is vital in emergency situations and supports heavily the different research, population health management and development activities, on the other side using the same data can lead to serious social and ethical problems caused by malicious actors. Currently, the regulation of the privacy data varies all over the world, however underlying principles are always defensive and protective towards patient privacy against general availability. The protective principles cause a defensive, data hiding attitude of the health system developers to avoid breaching the overall law regulations. It makes the policy makers and different - primarily drug - developers to find ways to treat data such a way that lead to ethical and political debates. In our paper we introduce how the blockchain technology can help solving the problem of secure data storing and ensuring data availability at the same time. We use the basic principles of the American HIPAA regulation, which defines the public availability criteria of health data, however the different local regulations may differ significantly. Blockchain's decentralized, intermediary-free, cryptographically secured attributes offer a new way of storing patient data securely and at the same time publicly available in a regulated way, where a well-designed distributed peer-to-peer network incentivize the smooth operation of a full-featured EHR system. © 2017 IEEE.","blockchain; cryptographically secured data storage; EHR; Health data storage; multisignature data access; patient privacy","Blockchain; Cryptography; Decision making; Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; Health; Hospital data processing; Information management; Laws and legislation; Peer to peer networks; Philosophical aspects; Population statistics; Problem solving; Research and development management; Data access; Data storage; Development activity; Disruptive technology; Health data; Health informations; Patient privacies; Underlying principles; Data privacy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047725777

Sharing health data is considered to be a critical approach to improve the quality of healthcare service and reduce medical costs. However, EMRs are fragmented across decentralized hospitals, which hinders data sharing and puts patients' privacy at risks. To address these issues, we propose a blockchain based privacy-preserving data sharing for EMRs, called BPDS. In BPDS, the original EMRs are stored securely in the cloud and the indexes are reserved in a tamper-proof consortium blockchain. By this means, the risk of the medical data leakage could be greatly reduced, and at the same time, the indexes in blockchain ensure that the EMRs can not be modified arbitrarily. Secure data sharing can be accomplished automatically according to the predefined access permissions of patients through the smart contracts of blockchain. Besides, the joint-design of the CP-ABE-based access control mechanism and the content extraction signature scheme provides strong privacy preservation in data sharing. Security analysis shows that BPDS is a secure and effective way to realize data sharing for EMRs. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Access control; Blockchain; Data privacy; Health care; Medical computing; Access control mechanism; Access permissions; Content extraction; Critical approach; Electronic medical record; Privacy preservation; Privacy preserving; Quality of health care; Electronic document exchange",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063464219

In other situations where personally identifying information is not needed to perform analyses, studies have shown that anonymization approaches such as k-anonymity or l-diversity cannot safeguard the information from inadvertent or malicious exposure.

Yet, customers have become reluctant to share data due to privacy concerns. From a psychological perspective, a reduction of users' perceived risks should result in a higher willingness to share sensitive data. The development of blockchain-supported, multi-part computation thereby represents an interesting novel empirical context to study such willingness to disclose personal data, as such technologies involve a privacy-preserving approach that could not only technically solve privacy issues but also ought to address precisely the user's risk perception. Therefore, we conducted an online experiment with 420 participants to examine the willingness to disclose personal data dependent on different privacy protection mechanisms. A deception based experiment allowed to measure not only user intention, but also real user behavior. Surprisingly, our results demonstrate that participants shared similar amounts of personal data for blockchain-supported approaches and standard privacy policies. Even though an aversion to the blockchain system due to its novelty and potentially perceived complexity was not detected. Furthermore, we found that the willingness to share data increased significantly specifically for technically affine people when they were presented with the opportunity to monetize their data.
