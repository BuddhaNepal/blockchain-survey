This paper further explores how digital transformations like the use of blockchain technology can aid offline/omnichannel retailers in reviving sales via permission marketing for impulse products. Design/methodology/approach: The authors followed a qualitative research design and conducted 24 personal interviews with millennials and 15 interviews with offline/omnichannel retailers from an emerging economy. The data collected were analyzed using the thematic analysis procedure. Findings: The authors discuss their findings under three themes – customers' conscious impulse buying during the pandemic, customers' unconscious impulse buying during the pandemic, and a viable solution for retailers in response to the pandemic. Practical implications: The authors suggest that marketers primarily from an offline/omnichannel store should adapt to permission marketing and use technologies like blockchain for the digital transformation of their marketing strategies. Doing so can help offline retailers minimize future damages in the retail sector during emergency situations. Originality/value: This paper is one of the first that explores how impulse – pure, suggestion, planned and reminder – purchases got affected during the COVID-19 pandemic disruptions in an emerging economy. This paper is also one of the first to explore the role of permission marketing and digital transformation by the use of blockchain in helping offline retailers in forming swift trust and practice trust-based marketing. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Blockchain; Consumer trust; Digital transformation; Impulse buying; Permission marketing; Retailing","Consumer behavior; Sales; Block-chain; Consumer trust; Digital transformation; Emergency situation; Emerging economies; Impulse buying; Offline; Offline retailers; Permission marketing; Retailing; Blockchain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130067686

One of the main changes in healthcare is the creation of the Electronic Health Record (EHR), which records all the patient's medical data in a digital medium. However, with creating the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the data owner must grant consent for third parties to collect, process, and store user data. In this context, the present work proposes Heimdall, a blockchain-based consent management framework that meets the requirements set by GDPR. We used a queuing system to assist in receiving requests, an object storage system to store patient data, and a memory database to record the transaction status. In our tests, Heimdall managed consents satisfactorily, where we were able to achieve a consistent amount of reading and writing transactions before saturating our test environment. © 2023 IEEE.","Blockchain; Consent; Eletronic Health Record; GDPR; Smart contract","Blockchain; Digital storage; Health care; Hospital data processing; Block-chain; Consent; Consent managements; Electronic health; Eletronic health record; General data protection regulations; Health records; Healthcare sectors; Management frameworks; Medical data; Smart contract",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85149175385

The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) establishes that subject of care should give explicit consent to the treatment of her personal data, and organizations must obey the individual's will. Nevertheless, few solutions focus on guaranteeing the proper execution of consents. We propose a service-oriented architecture, backed by blockchain technology, that enables: (1) tamper-proof and immutable storage of subject of care consents; (2) a fine-grained access control for protecting health data according to consents; and (3) auditing tasks for supervisory authorities (or subjects of care themselves) to assess that healthcare organizations comply with GDPR and granted consents. Standards for health information exchange and access control are adopted to guarantee interoperability. Access control events and the subject of care consents are maintained on a blockchain, providing a trusted collaboration between organizations, supervisory authorities, and individuals. A prototype of the architecture has been implemented as a proof of concept to evaluate the performance of critical components. The application of subject of care consent to control the treatment of personal health data in federated and distributed environments is a pressing concern.

The pandemic has changed human life, attitude, and behavior. This pandemic added a burden to people’s life and health. With the new variants of SARS-CoV-2, a lot of people are even scared of going to the health centers to get the COVID-19 evaluation in fear of contamination and contagious, which caused the surge in the symptoms at later stages. Data collected across various sources can play an important role in predicting and identifying of COVID-19 virus based on the models and the classifications of this data using the most sophisticated machine learning models. The concern here is accessing or transferring an individual’s data from their personal health devices which defers users’ privacy. In the recent past, there are a lot of research that has been done these days on how blockchain can help to securely track and transfer the data across trusted sources. Adding to this, federated learning also is helping on-device data usage without any critical data to be transferred to various external sources. The proposed study directs the stability of frequent health status with the help of wearable devices that capture health metrics like heart rate, blood oxygen levels, breathing rate, muscle activities, stress, emotions, movement patterns, sleep activity, precipitation, and mind/cognitive functions with the introduction of the data streams and models that can seamlessly transfer the data, with the assurance of data integrity, privacy, and control which is the scope of this paper. The usage of both the emerging technologies provides a value addition in terms of health data exchange with effective data distribution with decentralized privacy and computation. We have also introduced a consent-based personal health device registration mechanism on a blockchain consensus network with digital identity to allow and take back controls over who can access their data. We believe that this solution and the implementation would help everyone to predict the possible COVID-19 infections keeping data privacy at the most priority. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Distributed ledger; On-device learning; Secure aggregation; Secure by device consent; Training loop",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140461282

We use the interplanetary file system (IPFS) for storing the original EHRs. Smart contracts and proxy re-encryption technology are implemented for permission delegation. In order to ensure data security, we use attribute-based encryption to provide fine-grained access control. Additionally, blockchain is used to achieve traceability and immutability. We deploy smart contracts so that the delegation depth can be set by delegators. Security analysis of the proposed protocol shows that our solution meets the designed goals.

Mobile applications and websites access the sensors and use them in a variety of ways. Permission is required to access permission-imposed sensors, while users can access no-permission imposed sensors directly without any permission by using the generic sensor application programming interface (API). An attacker targets these sensors and makes smartphones vulnerable at the application and network level. Attackers gain access to sensor information and use it for various purposes like identifying personal identification numbers (PINs) and stealing personal information. This paper presents BPLMSBT, a novel Blockchain-based permission list for mitigating smartphone sensor-based threats by allowing benign users to access sensors through various channels. The permission list contains benign sources with sensor access permissions, while the blacklist contains malicious sources that access the sensors. Blockchain avoids the risks of centralized lists and maintains the list's integrity through the immutability feature. Experimental results indicate that the proposed defence mechanism consumes less overhead and is more efficient. An informal security analysis proved that the BPLMSBT is capable of protecting against various attacks. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","blacklist; intrusion; permission list; security; Sensors; threats","Application programming interfaces (API); Blockchain; Intrusion detection; Motion analysis; Blacklist; Block-chain; Blocklist; Intelligent sensors; Intrusion; Motion detection; Permission list; Security; Smart phones; Threat; Smartphones",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128673715

To solve the above problems, we propose a novel blockchain-based data sharing scheme (BDSS) with fine-grained access control and permission revocation in this paper, which regards the medical environment as the application scenario. In this scheme, we separate the public part and private part of the electronic medical record (EMR). Then, we use symmetric searchable encryption (SSE) technology to encrypt these two parts separately, and use attribute-based encryption (ABE) technology to encrypt symmetric keys which used in SSE technology separately. This guarantees better fine-grained access control and makes patients to share data at ease. In addition, we design a mechanism for EMR permission grant and revocation so that hospital can verify attribute set to determine whether to grant and revoke access permission through blockchain, so it is no longer necessary for ciphertext re-encryption and key update. Finally, security analysis, security proof and performance evaluation demonstrate that the proposed scheme is safe and effective in practical applications.

Cross-enterprise document sharing (XDS) is the crucial system of sharing personalized healthcare data. Furthermore, dynamic consent is vital to the XDS system, because it respects people's autonomy and achieves recognition of data sovereignty. Because of its transparency, blockchain is a powerful system for managing storage and computing without a trusted third party. Besides, ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) extends public-key encryption by implying access control policies in ciphertexts, making it suitable for protecting the privacy of individual healthcare data in versatile cases. Particularly, we use hospital name, ""date""and ""department""as attribute strings in the access control policies. Consequently, based on consortium blockchain and CP-ABE, we propose a patient-centered XDS and a dynamic consent framework. Compared with previous related literature, we make the proposed framework consistent with current practices and achieve favorable criteria, such as data confidentiality, data recoverability and time-aware ciphertext. Further, we conduct comprehensive experiments to show the feasibility and practicality. © 2022 ACM.","consortium blockchain; CP-ABE; cross-enterprise document sharing; data sovereignty; dynamic consent","Access control; Digital storage; Health care; Public key cryptography; Access control policies; Block-chain; Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryptions; Ciphertexts; Consortium blockchain; Cross-enterprise document sharing; Data sovereignty; Document sharing; Dynamic consents; Patient-centered healthcare; Blockchain",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130706226

The platform consisted of three parts: web and mobile application user interface, study management platform, and blockchain platform. Hyperledger Fabric, an enterprise-grade private blockchain framework, was used to integrate blockchain into the study consent platform. We conducted user acceptance tests and applied feedback to the improvement of the platform. Identity and role-based access control was constructed by combining mobile-application-based certificate system and access control functionalities in Hyperledger fabric. Data were encrypted using SHA-256 prior to transmission to blockchain server and TLS protocol was used for in-transit encryption. File-system level encryption was separated implemented within the security measures from Amazon RDS. Users' experience in the clinical trial was acceptable in the ease and usefulness of the platform.

We aimed to evaluate the real-world feasibility of a blockchain-based dynamic consent platform (METORY) in a decentralized and multicenter trial. The study consisted of three visits (i.e., screening and 2 follow-up visits) with a 2-week interval. Each subject was required to report the self-measured body temperatures and take a virtual investigational drug by entering the unique drug code on the application. To simulate real-world study settings, two major (i.e., changes in the schedule of body temperature measurement) and three minor protocol amendments (i.e., nonsignificant changes without any changes in the procedures) were set. Overall study completion rates, proportion of consent, and response time to each protocol amendment and adherence were evaluated. A total of 60 subjects (30 in each center) were enrolled in two study centers. All subjects completed the study, and the overall proportion of consent to each protocol amendment was 95.7 ± 13.7% (mean ± SD), with a median response time of 0.2 h. Overall, subjects took 90.8% ± 19.2% of the total drug, whereas compliance with the schedule was 69.1% ± 27.0%. Subjects reported 96.7% ± 4.2% of the total body temperature measurements whereas the adherence to the schedule was 59.0% ± 25.0%, which remarkably decreased after major protocol amendments. In conclusion, we evaluated a blockchain-based dynamic consent platform in real clinical trial settings. The results suggested that major changes should be avoided unless subjects’ proper understanding is warranted. © 2022 The Authors.

Firstly, health data is fragmented and its quality needs to be improved. Data fragmentation means that it is difficult to integrate the patient data stored by multiple health service providers. The quality of these heterogeneous data also needs to be improved for better utilization. Secondly, data sharing among patients, healthcare service providers and medical researchers is inadequate. Thirdly, while sharing health data, patients’ right to privacy must be protected, and patients should have authority over who can access their data. In traditional health data sharing system, because of centralized management, data can easily be stolen, manipulated. These systems also ignore patient’s authority and privacy. Researchers have proposed some blockchain-based health data sharing solutions where blockchain is used for consensus management. Blockchain enables multiple parties who do not fully trust each other to exchange their data. However, the practice of smart contracts supporting these solutions has not been studied in detail. We propose CrowdMed-II, a health data management framework based on blockchain, which could address the above-mentioned problems of health data. We study the design of major smart contracts in our framework and propose two smart contract structures. We also introduce a novel search contract for searching patients in the framework. We evaluate their efficiency based on the execution costs on Ethereum. Our design improves on those previously proposed, lowering the computational costs of the framework. This allows the framework to operate at scale and is more feasible for widespread adoption. © 2021, The Author(s).","Blockchain; Consent management; Health data; Smart contracts","Data privacy; Health care; Hospital data processing; Information management; Block-chain; Consent managements; Data fragmentation; Data Sharing; Health data; Health services; Healthcare industry; Heterogeneous data; Patient data; Service provider; Smart contract",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122029942

Common challenges for designing such systems include prosumers' privacy and security threats. To this end, Blockchain-based solutions have gained a lot of attention, though most existing solutions have either employed permissionless blockchain, which is far from pragmatic for a P2P energy trading system with peers permitted to join or leave the network at their whim; or relatively secure yet inefficient permissioned blockchains. Hence, this article presents a flexible permissioned ascription (FPA) scheme that uses on-chain and off-chain permissioning scheme via Orion and Metamask wallet. It also employs contract permissioning through a JavaScript based chain code deployed over Hyperledger Besu (an Ethereum based permissioned Blockchain network) with istanbul byzantine fault tolerant (IBFT) 2.0 consensus algorithm. Additionally, the proposed framework is emulated for development of a working prototype for a P2P energy trading system. Its performance evaluation has been conducted and monitored with Grafana, Prometheus, Hyperledger Caliper, and Kibana for parameters such as latency, throughput, success rate, CPU time, block time, block behind time, memory usage, garbage collection (GC) time, and performance of the validator nodes. The latency of IBFT 2.0 was found five times lesser than that of Ethereum and two times lesser than HF RAFT and KAFKA under varying conditions. Also, the measured throughput was 1.5 times higher than RAFT and Kafka and three times higher than that of Ethereum. The average block confirmation time measured is 5-6 s. The GC usage measured very less, i.e., 0.5-0.8%, with the proposed framework. It has been observed that the proposed energy-trading framework provides an efficient performance for deploying, transferring, and querying the energy transaction to a P2P energy-trading Blockchain network when compared with other consensus mechanisms. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Blockchain; hyperledger besu; off-chain; on-chain permissioning; peer-to-peer energy trading","Blockchain; Peer to peer networks; Power markets; Decentralized energy; Energy sector; Energy trading; Fault-tolerant capability; High securities; Hybrid framework; Performance bottlenecks; Security threats; Smart power grids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110883347

In this review, we describe the studies on the current privacy policies of fitness app providers, heuristically evaluate the methods for consent management by fitness providers, summarize the gaps identified in our review of these studies, and discuss potential solutions for filling the gaps identified. We have identified four main problems related to preserving the privacy of users of fitness apps: lack of system transparency, lack of privacy policy legibility, concerns regarding one-time consent, and issues of noncompliance regarding consent management.

Due to travel restrictions, safety concerns, and expensive travelling the younger generation is showing interest in virtual tourism instead of traditional tourism. However, virtual tourism does not financially benefit the service providers as compared to traditional tourism stakeholders. An online system is essential to provide a central point of access to various tourism sites along with usage, permission, and payment control. In this paper, a secure blockchain-based broker service for users and content providers is proposed, which allows tourism sites to announce their virtual tours and provide accessibility and accountability. Meanwhile, it enables users to register, subscribe, access, and be billed according to their usage. The permission control module ensures authentication and authorization, while the usage control provides accountability to the predefined service level agreement. The transactions are stored on the blockchain to ensure the integrity of data and smart contracts are used to ensure automatic usage and permission control.

With the addition of smart contracts, blockchains can track and verify arbitrary computations - which enables blockchain users to verify the provenance of information derived from data through the blockchain. This provenance comes at the cost of data confidentiality and user privacy, however, which is unacceptable for many sensitive applications. The need for verifiable yet confidential data sharing and computation has led some to add trusted execution environment (TEE) hardware to blockchain platforms. By moving sensitive operations (e.g., data decryption and analysis) off of the blockchain and into a TEE, they get both the confidentiality of TEEs and the transparency of blockchains without the need to completely trust any one party in the data-sharing ecosystem.In this paper, we build on our TEE-enabled blockchain data-sharing system, Amanuensis, to ensure the freshness of access-control lists shared between the blockchain and TEE, and to improve the privacy of users interacting within the system. We also detail how TEE-based remote attestation help us to achieve information provenance - specifically, how to achieve information provenance in the context of the Intel SGX trusted execution environment. Finally, we present an evaluation of our system, in which we test several real-world machine-learning applications (logistic regression, kNN, SVM) to determine the run-time overhead of information confidentiality and provenance. Each machine-learning program exhibited a slowdown between 1.1 and 2.8x when run inside of our confidential environment, and took an average of 59 milliseconds to verify the provenance of an input data set. © 2022 IEEE.",,"Access control; Data privacy; Machine learning; Audit trails; Block-chain; Data confidentiality; Data Sharing; Data systems; Data users; Sensitive application; Trusted execution environments; Trusted party; User privacy; Blockchain",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140912077

Traditional access control models require one centralized authority that stores all the information for access control and validates access rights. This single point of failure in IoT access control could lead to situations where a single breach can cause sensitive information leakage across the entire system. Various studies have been conducted to mitigate this security risk by introducing a decentralized architecture based on blockchain technology called BBAC. However, most BBAC models consider only a simple access control situation, which can lead to a 'the Greatest privilege problem'. This study proposes a novel access control model that enforces minimum privilege to an access token by the division and modification of access rights. As a result, we contributed to enhancing the practicality of the BBAC and mitigating risks that may arise in the delegation process. © 2022 IEEE.","Access control model; BBAC; Blockchain; IoT","Access control models; Blockchain; Access control models; Access rights; BBAC; Block-chain; Centralised; Entire system; Information leakage; Security problems; Sensitive informations; Single point; Internet of things",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130790315

Combined with many other technologies, it uses the internet of things, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, big data, and machine learning. Several industries, especially governments, have employed blockchain technology to overcome a variety of security challenges. Blockchain focuses on double-spending and distributed consensus. However, blockchain networks are inefficient and scalable. Communication overhead occurs due to many replications. This paper proposes an adaptive practical Byzantine fault tolerance algorithm in permission blockchains. This method divides the node into trust nodes and faulty nodes. The nodes with faulty reputations are excluded from voting. Also, the identified trust node has a high reputation in the consensus process. A majority of voting values select the master node. This adaptive PBFT algorithm is excellent for long-term periodicity and increased scalability, and lower overall communication costs. Finally, the performance of adaptive PBFT is compared to other algorithms. © 2022 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd..

These strategies aim not only regional planning, but also economic development and people’s quality of life. This refers to the concept of smart territories. To achieve their objectives, smart territories generally use citizens’ data to offer them services and support them in better individualized decision-making. However, a major problem arises in data management, as it is necessary to have the consent of users to access and use data. In this article, we propose a generic blockchain-based model for consent-based data sharing in the context of smart territories, while putting users at the center of control of their data. We take advantage of ADA-M (Automatable Discovery and Access Matrix), a matrix that provides a standardized way to unambiguously represent conditions related to discovery and access to data. We couple the use of ADA-M with a blockchain anchor system, which helps secure consent management for data access. This helps to develop an environment of digital trust for sharing data between users. Then, through a digital token, we offer a system of rewards for users in cases where their data is used for commercial purposes. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115263025

To optimize medical services for individual patients, an open ecosystem for the healthcare industry that allows the exchange and utilization of personal health records (PHRs) is required. However, under the current system of hospital-centered data management, it is difficult to implement the linking and sharing of PHRs in practice. To address this problem, in this study, we present the design and implementation of a patient-centered PHR platform using blockchain technology. This platform achieved transparency and reliability in information management by eliminating the risk of leakage and tampering/altering personal information, which could occur when using a PHR. In addition, the patient-consent system was applied to a PHR; thus, the patient acted as the user with ownership. The proposed blockchain-based PHR platform enables the integration of personal medical information with scattered distribution across multiple hospitals, and allows patients to freely use their health records in their daily lives and emergencies. The proposed platform is expected to serve as a stepping stone for patient-centered healthcare data management and utilization. © 2021 KSII.","Blockchain; Hyperledger Fabric; On-Chain/Off-Chain; Patient Consent; Personal Health Record","Diagnosis; Distributed ledger; Health care; Hospitals; Information management; Block-chain; Design and implementations; Disease prevention; Healthcare industry; Hyperledg fabric; Management systems; On-chain/off-chain; Paradigm shifts; Patient consent; Personal health record; Blockchain",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123638269

Significant concerns regarding data governance and security have reduced this sharing in practice. Blockchain could provide a secure method for sharing genomic data between involved parties and thus help overcome some of these issues. Objective: This study aims to contribute to the growing knowledge of the potential role of blockchain technology in supporting the sharing of clinical genomic data by describing blockchain-based dynamic consent architecture to support clinical genomic data sharing and provide a proof-of-concept implementation, called ConsentChain, for the architecture to explore its performance. Methods: The ConsentChain requirements were captured from a patient forum to identify security and consent concerns. The ConsentChain was developed on the Ethereum platform, in which smart contracts were used to model the actions of patients, who may provide or withdraw consent to share their data; the data creator, who collects and stores patient data; and the data requester, who needs to query and access the patient data. A detailed analysis was undertaken of the ConsentChain performance as a function of the number of transactions processed by the system. Results: We describe ConsentChain, a blockchain-based system that provides a web portal interface to support clinical genomic sharing. ConsentChain allows patients to grant or withdraw data requester access and allows data requesters to query and submit access to data stored in a secure off-chain database. We also developed an ontology model to represent patient consent elements into machine-readable codes to automate the consent and data access processes. Conclusions: Blockchains and smart contracts can provide an efficient and scalable mechanism to support dynamic consent functionality and address some of the barriers that inhibit genomic data sharing. However, they are not a complete answer, and a number of issues still need to be addressed before such systems can be deployed in practice, particularly in relation to verifying user credentials. © Faisal Albalwy, Andrew Brass, Angela Davies.

This paper introduces one of these advances - blockchain technologies - and argues that they can be used to share medical data in a secure and auditable fashion. In addition, some aspects of consent and data collection, as well as data access management and analysis, can be automated using blockchain-based smart contracts. This paper demonstrates how blockchain technologies can be used to further all three of the bioethical principles underlying consent requirements: the autonomy of patients, by giving them much greater control over their data; beneficence, by greatly facilitating medical research efficiency and by reducing biases and opportunities for errors; and justice, by enabling patients with rare or under-researched conditions to pseudonymously aggregate their data for analysis.

In 2018 the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force, committing companies to comply with lawful rules that stress their role and responsibilities in protecting the privacy of the legal persons that share personal data with them. In this paper we address the crucial challenges that companies face to achieve compliance with GDPR, and specifically to i) let data owners full visibility and control on the consents related to their own personal data, and ii) design services that can cope with consents that may change or be revoked dynamically. We propose a solution that relies on the blockchain technology to let data owners grant, access and rectify their consents in a decentralized peer-to-peer fashion, while guaranteeing consensual agreement of data owners and companies on the status of the relevant consents at any time. Although blockchains let all users access all contents freely, our solution suitably exploits encryption to both guarantee the integrity of the consents, and avoid any disclosure to third parties. At the company side, our approach settles a compliance broker that works in a publish-subscribe style to assist services in controlling their compliance to GDPR while the status of consents evolves on the blockchain. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

It can be used for access control by using smart contracts to distribute tokens. But also because of the immutability of the blockchain, it cannot dynamically revoke permission. This paper proposed an on-chain user permission management mechanism that could support automatic and active permission revocation. This model proposed an extended CP-ABE chain user permission management model, which realized the permission grant based on user attributes by smart contracts. Furthermore, on this basis, an extended CP-ABE permission revocation mechanism was proposed. The timestamp technology was used to realize the automatic revocation of permission, and the subset coverage algorithm was used to realize the active revocation of permission. A blockchain-based permission distribution model was built, and the permission revocation scheme was introduced into it to conduct experiments. Its performance was tested and analyzed. The experimental results showed that when the number of permission distributions is 1000, the delay is about 5 s. At the same time, the permission change is above 130TPS, which met actual application requirements. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Blockchain; Data security; Permission management","Access control; Artificial intelligence; Application requirements; Coverage algorithms; Distribution models; Management mechanisms; Permission management model; Revocation mechanism; Revocation scheme; Tamper proof; Blockchain",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112021876

However, sensing technologies increase the complexity of data collection points, making it difficult for users to consent to data collection. One possible solution for improving transparency in the consent management process is the use of blockchain, an immutable and timestamped ledger. Objective: This study aims to provide a conceptual framework based on technology aimed at mitigating trust issues in the consent management process. Methods: The consent management process was modeled using established methodologies to obtain a mapping of trust issues. This mapping was then used to develop a conceptual framework based on previous monitoring and surveillance architectures for connected devices. Results: In this paper, we present a model that maps trust issues in the informed consent process; a conceptual framework capable of providing all the necessary underlining technologies, components, and functionalities required to develop applications capable of managing the process of informed consent for AAL, powered by blockchain technology to ensure transparency; and a diagram showing an instantiation of the framework with entities comprising the participants in the blockchain network, suggesting possible technologies that can be used.

Sharing patients' data without their consent is a violation of the law and bears the risk of identity hack and misuse of healthcare data. Not all healthcare institutions follow a similar structure and semantic to store patients' data, making it almost impossible to share the data for research and better patient management. Centralized data management system is vulnerable to cyberattacks and data theft. It also creates lock-in problems for patients intending to migrate their data to any other institute. In this paper, a permissioned Blockchain with Proof of Authority (PoA) technology has been proposed that guarantees data privacy, data owner's control on sharing their sensitive information, and effective distributed management of healthcare records. It also addresses the importance of managing medical records in an interoperable manner, and the use of de facto standards such as Fast Healthcare Interoperable Resources (FHIR), which helps the meaningful exchange of healthcare records among all participants.

The data on the internet can be compromised and the performance can be bottlenecked. The solution to this problem is the blockchain technology. Reason for choosing this field is because blockchain is a new technology and now it is one of the most demanding field in the IT sector. Blockchain is based on peer-to-peer topology containing connected nodes. Each node has cryptographic hash of the previous node (no malicious or unauthorized node can enter the linked nodes), timestamp and relevant data. Blockchain provides resistance against the unwanted interference and modification of the data and each node has separate processing power thus enhancing security and performance of the host network. Permission-ed and Permission-less blockchain have their own properties and limitations and they can be used in different scenarios. In permission-less blockchain the nodes can be public, anyone can add nodes to increase the performance (Bitcoin), while permission-ed blockchain is used within enterprise or between enterprises where the nodes are private and new nodes need authorization to be added in link nodes. The aim of this paper is to study the permission-ed and permission less blockchain, their similarities and differences, some of the consensus algorithms they use. Outcome of the paper will be understanding of some of the consensus algorithms and proposing a two-tier architecture which will contain voting based algorithm for enhanced performance. © 2020 IEEE.","Architecture; Blockchain; Consensus algorithm; Permission-ed; Permission-less","Computer architecture; Intelligent systems; Network architecture; Consensus algorithms; Internet technology; Link nodes; Peer-to-peer topology; Processing power; Security and performance; Two-tier architecture; Voting systems; Blockchain",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103029219

An essential factor for the success of a CT is the appropriate management of its participants and their personal data. According to the current regulations, collecting and using personal data from participants must comply with rigorous standards. Therefore, healthcare institutes need to obtain freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous consent before being able to collect the data. Some of the major limitations of the current technological solutions are the lack of control over the granularity of consent grants, as well as the difficulty of handling dynamic changes of consent over time.

The usage of blockchain provides a set of features that allow maintaining consent information with trust guarantees while avoiding the need for a dedicated or centralized third trusted party.

As an evolving field of medicine, e-Health involves the electronic processing of a patient's personal, medical and other health-related data to improve healthcare delivery. Data captured from clinical interactions between patients and their care providers, as well as health data collected through medical sensors, provide a rich source of data, known as patient medical records (PMRs), which can be processed in various ways to enhance the delivery of healthcare services. However, indiscriminate processing of PMRs could potentially result in the violation of the security or privacy of patients. To ensure that PMRs are not processed in ways that could be harmful to the security or privacy of the patients, modern data protection regulations, such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), requires healthcare service provides to obtain the consent of a patient for any processing operation on their PMRs. The mechanism by which a patient exercises their right to control who can process their PMRs, when and for what purpose, is referred to as consent management in e-Health. Existing health information technology systems do not provide adequate support for consent management; there is a lack of transparency and auditability in the existing systems to monitor and ensure that healthcare service providers comply to the relevant data protection regulations in processing PMRs. The emerging blockchain technology offers an opportunity to design an e-Health consent management system that is compliant with modern data protection regulations such as GDPR. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of an e-Health consent management framework, based on the state-of-the-art blockchain technologies, for processing PMRs. Our analysis confirms that our system satisfies the requirements for consent management in e-Health. © 2020 IEEE.","blockchain; consent management; distributed ledger; health care; Hyperledger Fabric; patient medical records (PMRs)","Blockchain; eHealth; Metadata; Privacy by design; Consent managements; Design and implementations; Electronic processing; General data protection regulations; Health information technologies; Healthcare delivery; Healthcare services; Processing operations; Information management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098878992

Healthcare organizations also have difficulties in dealing with patient consent. The objective of this research is to develop a system for patients to manage their consent flexibly and for healthcare organizations to obtain patient consent efficiently for a variety of purposes. Methods: We introduce a new e-con-sent model, which uses a purpose-based access control scheme; it is implemented by a blockchain system using Hyperledger Fabric. All metadata of patient records, consents, and data access are written immutably on the blockchain and shared among participant organizations. We also created a blockchain chaincode that performs business logic managing patient consent. Results: We developed a prototype and checked business logics with the chaincode by validating doctors’ data access with purpose-based consent of patients stored in the blockchain. The results demonstrate that our system provides a fine-grained way of handling medical staff ’s access requests with diverse intended purposes for accessing data. In addition, patients can create, update, and withdraw their consents in the blockchain. Conclusions: Our consent model is a solution for consent management both for patients and healthcare organizations.

The protocol is based on the concept of Ronald L. Rivest published in the paper ‘Electronic Lottery Tickets as Micropayments’ (1997). The “lottery ticket” was designed for centralized systems where a trusted third party is required to provide payments, and in some scenarios, is also a lottery facilitator. The existing blockchain protocol cannot accommodate peer-to-peer “lottery” micropayments at least, without creating payment channels. Therefore, the implementation requires the development of an upgrade to the blockchain core. In the result, RandpayUTXO was introduced – an infinitely spendable zero output that requires the payee's signature to be published in the blockchain. Randpay is considered to be the first blockchain protocol to require the payee to sign the transaction by their private key. This is a significant feature to improve, not only microtransactions but also extend the use of the blockchain for legal deeds that require a payee's consent to be recognized in legal applications. The second important innovation of this research is the implementation of Blum's ‘coin flipping by telephone’ problem to design a ‘lottery ticket’ that does not require any third party to facilitate the lottery.

It is especially applicable when the owner and manager of the object are inconsistent. With the development of the Internet of Things, there are more and more scenes where object owners and managers are inconsistent, but the research on permission delegation in access control based on blockchain is not perfect. Therefore, once implemented in these blockchain-based access control algorithms, the permission delegation tends to have an unauthorized access. Based on the analysis of the causes for the unauthorized access vulnerability, this paper proposes a token-constrained permission delegation algorithm (TCPDA), which converts the access control policy corresponding to permissions into constraints for permission use, embeds the constraints in the permission token, and forms constraints on the transfer of tokens. Only subjects that meet the constraint conditions can receive tokens, thereby solving unauthorized access vulnerability caused by permission delegation. Since not all access control models can transform strategies into constraints and integrate them into blockchain tokens, this paper also proposes a permission delegation algorithm for decision-making entities to make desirable decisions. Finally, the security analysis shows that the two proposed schemes can overcome the unauthorized access vulnerability caused by permission delegation, and the algorithm performance is analyzed through experiments. © 2013 IEEE.","Access control; blockchain; permission delegation; unauthorized access vulnerability","Blockchain; Decision making; Managers; Access control models; Access control policies; Algorithm performance; Constraint conditions; Decision-making entities; Security analysis; Unauthorized access; Access control",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090950440

Health data sharing is dependent on obtaining individual consent which, in turn, is hindered by a lack of resources. To this extent, blockchain-based platforms facilitate data sharing by creating a trusted distributed network of users. These users are enabled to share their data without depending on the time and resources of specific actors (such as the health services). In blockchain-based platforms, data governance mechanisms become very important due to the need to specify and monitor data sharing and data use conditions. In this article, we present a blockchain-based data-sharing consent model for access control over individual health data. We use smart contracts to dynamically represent the individual's consent over health data and to enable data requesters to search and access those data. The dynamic consent model extends to two ontologies: the Data Use Ontology (DUO) which models the individual consent of users and the Automatable Discovery and Access Matrix (ADA-M), which describes queries from data requesters. We deploy the model on Ethereum blockchain and evaluate different data sharing scenarios. The contribution of this article consists of the creation of an individual consent model for health data sharing platforms. Such a model guarantees that individual consent is respected and that all the participants in the data sharing platform are accountable. The evaluation of our solution indicates that such a data sharing model provides a flexible decision-making approach over data usage by data requesters. Our experimental evaluation shows that the proposed model is efficient and adapts to personalized access control policies in different data-sharing scenarios. © 2013 IEEE.","Blockchain; data sharing; distributed ledgers; EHR exchange; individual consent","Access control; Blockchain; Decision making; Health; Monitoring; Ontology; Data governances; Data-sharing platforms; Distributed networks; Dynamic consents; Electronic health record; Experimental evaluation; Health-care system; Personalized access controls; Data Sharing",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090267095

This requires a robust, trusted and flexible mechanism for patients to offer consent to share their data. Furthermore, new IT technologies make it easier to give patients more control over their data, including the right to revoke consent. These characteristics challenge the traditional paper-based, single-organisation-led consent process. The Dovetail digital consent application uses a mobile application and blockchain based infrastructure to offer this capability, as part of a pilot allowing patients to have their data shared amongst digital tools, empowering patients to manage their condition within an integrated care setting. Objective: To evaluate patient perceptions towards existing consent processes, and the Dovetail blockchain based digital consent application as a means to manage data sharing in the context of diabetes care. Method: Patients with diabetes at a General Practitioner practice were recruited. Data were collected using focus groups and questionnaires. Thematic analysis of the focus group transcripts and descriptive statistics of the questionnaires was performed. Results: There was a lack of understanding of existing consent processes in place, and many patients did not have any recollection of having previously given consent. The digital consent application received favourable feedback, with patients recognising the value of the capability offered by the application. Patients overwhelmingly favoured the digital consent application over existing practice. Conclusions: Digital consent was received favourably, with patients recognising that it addresses the main limitations of the current process. Feedback on potential improvements was received.

The main reason for that is data custodians being reluctant to disseminate the records to the external entities due to security and privacy concerns. As the ultimate ownership of medical records lies with the individual patient, this is best resolved by integrating patient consent with existing access control mechanisms. Recently, blockchain has been shown as a promising technology to provide secure and privacy-preserving data sharing on distributed and decentralized environments.

However, there is a need for more work to better characterize, understand and evaluate the employment of blockchain technology in the healthcare industry. In this paper, a design of blockchain based system, namely MedChain, for managing medical records is proposed. MedChain is designed to improve the current systems as it provides interoperable, secure, and effective access for medical records by patients, health care providers, and other third parties, while keeping the patients' privacy. MedChain employs timed-based smart contracts for governing transactions and controlling accesses to electronic medical records. It adopts advanced encryption techniques for providing further security. This work proposes a new incentive mechanism that leverages the degree of health providers regarding their efforts on maintaining medical records and creating new blocks. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the MedChain performance, and results indicate the efficiency of our proposal in handling a large dataset at low latency. © 2013 IEEE.","Blockchain; Electronic medical records; Incentive mechanism; Smart contracts","Cryptography; Data privacy; Health care; Interoperability; Large dataset; Medical computing; Electronic medical record; Encryption technique; Financial applications; Health care providers; Healthcare industry; Incentive mechanism; Medical record; Recent researches; Blockchain",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075631977

The emergence of blockchain provides a new direction for data protection and data tokenization. Nonetheless, existing cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin using Proof-of-Work are particularly energy intensive. On the other hand, classical protocols such as Byzantine agreement do not work efficiently in an open environment. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a permission-less blockchain with a novel double-DAG (directed acyclic graph) architecture called DLattice, where each account has its own Account-DAG and all accounts make up a greater Node-DAG structure. DLattice parallelizes the growth of each account's Account-DAG, each of which is not influenced by other accounts' irrelevant transactions. DLattice uses a new DPoS-BA-DAG(PANDA) protocol to reach consensus among users only when the forks are observed. Based on proposed DLattice, we introduce a process of data tokenization, including data assembling, data anchoring, and data authorization. We implement DLattice and evaluate its performance on 25 ECS virtual machines, simulating up to 500 nodes. The experimental results show that DLattice reaches a consensus in 10 seconds, achieves desired throughput, and incurs almost no penalty for scaling to more users. © 2013 IEEE.","Blockchain; byzantine agreement protocols; consensus algorithm; data tokenization; directed acyclic graph","Directed graphs; Graph theory; Byzantine Agreement; Consensus algorithms; DAG structures; Data ownership; Digital information; Directed acyclic graph (DAG); Open environment; Tokenization; Blockchain",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065336696

We now face a critical need for such innovation, as personalization and data science prompt patients to engage in the details of their healthcare and restore agency over their medical data. In this paper, we propose MedRec: a novel, decentralized record management system to handle EMRs, using blockchain technology. Our system gives patients a comprehensive, immutable log and easy access to their medical information across providers and treatment sites. Leveraging unique blockchain properties, MedRec manages authentication, confidentiality, accountability and data sharing - crucial considerations when handling sensitive information. A modular design integrates with providers' existing, local data storage solutions, facilitating interoperability and making our system convenient and adaptable. We incentivize medical stakeholders (researchers, public health authorities, etc.) to participate in the network as blockchain ""miners"". This provides them with access to aggregate, anonymized data as mining rewards, in return for sustaining and securing the network via Proof of Work. MedRec thus enables the emergence of data economics, supplying big data to empower researchers while engaging patients and providers in the choice to release metadata. The purpose of this short paper is to expose, prior to field tests, a working prototype through which we analyze and discuss our approach. © 2016 IEEE.","access control; cryptographic protocols; distributed information systems; electronic medical records","Access control; Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; Electronic document exchange; Interoperability; Medical computing; Medical information systems; Patient treatment; Cryptographic protocols; Distributed information systems; Electronic medical record; Electronic medical records (EMRs); Medical information; Personalizations; Record management systems; Sensitive informations; Big data",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991717011
