,"Nigam A., Behl A., Pereira V., Sangal S.",Impulse purchases during emergency situations: exploring permission marketing and the role of blockchain,2023.0,Scopus,,,,,,,10.1108/IMDS-12-2021-0799,,,,,,,,,,,,"Purpose: The paper explores how consumer behavior for purchasing impulse products changed in the complex and disruptive (emergency) situation of the COVID-19 pandemic when the customer is shopping in-home and not visiting the offline stores in an emerging economy context. This paper further explores how digital transformations like the use of blockchain technology can aid offline/omnichannel retailers in reviving sales via permission marketing for impulse products. Design/methodology/approach: The authors followed a qualitative research design and conducted 24 personal interviews with millennials and 15 interviews with offline/omnichannel retailers from an emerging economy. The data collected were analyzed using the thematic analysis procedure. Findings: The authors discuss their findings under three themes – customers' conscious impulse buying during the pandemic, customers' unconscious impulse buying during the pandemic, and a viable solution for retailers in response to the pandemic. Practical implications: The authors suggest that marketers primarily from an offline/omnichannel store should adapt to permission marketing and use technologies like blockchain for the digital transformation of their marketing strategies. Doing so can help offline retailers minimize future damages in the retail sector during emergency situations. Originality/value: This paper is one of the first that explores how impulse – pure, suggestion, planned and reminder – purchases got affected during the COVID-19 pandemic disruptions in an emerging economy. This paper is also one of the first to explore the role of permission marketing and digital transformation by the use of blockchain in helping offline retailers in forming swift trust and practice trust-based marketing. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",,,Industrial Management and Data Systems,4.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130067686&doi=10.1108%2fIMDS-12-2021-0799&partnerID=40&md5=28130b47d36a1044add5a5458c2ededa,Blockchain; Consumer trust; Digital transformation; Impulse buying; Permission marketing; Retailing,Consumer behavior; Sales; Block-chain; Consumer trust; Digital transformation; Emergency situation; Emerging economies; Impulse buying; Offline; Offline retailers; Permission marketing; Retailing; Blockchain,Article,Final,,2-s2.0-85130067686
,"Huh K.Y., Moon S.J., Jeong S.-U., Kim M.-J., Yang W., Jeong M., Kim M.-G., Lee S.",Evaluation of a blockchain-based dynamic consent platform (METORY) in a decentralized and multicenter clinical trial using virtual drugs,2022.0,Scopus,,,,,,,10.1111/cts.13246,,,,,,,,,,,,"Blockchain is a novel data architecture characterized by a chronological sequence of blocks in a decentralized manner. We aimed to evaluate the real-world feasibility of a blockchain-based dynamic consent platform (METORY) in a decentralized and multicenter trial. The study consisted of three visits (i.e., screening and 2 follow-up visits) with a 2-week interval. Each subject was required to report the self-measured body temperatures and take a virtual investigational drug by entering the unique drug code on the application. To simulate real-world study settings, two major (i.e., changes in the schedule of body temperature measurement) and three minor protocol amendments (i.e., nonsignificant changes without any changes in the procedures) were set. Overall study completion rates, proportion of consent, and response time to each protocol amendment and adherence were evaluated. A total of 60 subjects (30 in each center) were enrolled in two study centers. All subjects completed the study, and the overall proportion of consent to each protocol amendment was 95.7 ± 13.7% (mean ± SD), with a median response time of 0.2 h. Overall, subjects took 90.8% ± 19.2% of the total drug, whereas compliance with the schedule was 69.1% ± 27.0%. Subjects reported 96.7% ± 4.2% of the total body temperature measurements whereas the adherence to the schedule was 59.0% ± 25.0%, which remarkably decreased after major protocol amendments. In conclusion, we evaluated a blockchain-based dynamic consent platform in real clinical trial settings. The results suggested that major changes should be avoided unless subjects’ proper understanding is warranted. © 2022 The Authors.

Common challenges for designing such systems include prosumers' privacy and security threats. To this end, Blockchain-based solutions have gained a lot of attention, though most existing solutions have either employed permissionless blockchain, which is far from pragmatic for a P2P energy trading system with peers permitted to join or leave the network at their whim; or relatively secure yet inefficient permissioned blockchains. Hence, this article presents a flexible permissioned ascription (FPA) scheme that uses on-chain and off-chain permissioning scheme via Orion and Metamask wallet. It also employs contract permissioning through a JavaScript based chain code deployed over Hyperledger Besu (an Ethereum based permissioned Blockchain network) with istanbul byzantine fault tolerant (IBFT) 2.0 consensus algorithm. Additionally, the proposed framework is emulated for development of a working prototype for a P2P energy trading system. Its performance evaluation has been conducted and monitored with Grafana, Prometheus, Hyperledger Caliper, and Kibana for parameters such as latency, throughput, success rate, CPU time, block time, block behind time, memory usage, garbage collection (GC) time, and performance of the validator nodes. The latency of IBFT 2.0 was found five times lesser than that of Ethereum and two times lesser than HF RAFT and KAFKA under varying conditions. Also, the measured throughput was 1.5 times higher than RAFT and Kafka and three times higher than that of Ethereum. The average block confirmation time measured is 5-6 s. The GC usage measured very less, i.e., 0.5-0.8%, with the proposed framework. It has been observed that the proposed energy-trading framework provides an efficient performance for deploying, transferring, and querying the energy transaction to a P2P energy-trading Blockchain network when compared with other consensus mechanisms. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",,,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,12.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110883347&doi=10.1109%2fTII.2021.3096832&partnerID=40&md5=196a23e618e7ef8e2481cde17bda01d1,Blockchain; hyperledger besu; off-chain; on-chain permissioning; peer-to-peer energy trading,Blockchain; Peer to peer networks; Power markets; Decentralized energy; Energy sector; Energy trading; Fault-tolerant capability; High securities; Hybrid framework; Performance bottlenecks; Security threats; Smart power grids,Article,Final,,2-s2.0-85110883347

With the addition of smart contracts, blockchains can track and verify arbitrary computations - which enables blockchain users to verify the provenance of information derived from data through the blockchain. This provenance comes at the cost of data confidentiality and user privacy, however, which is unacceptable for many sensitive applications. The need for verifiable yet confidential data sharing and computation has led some to add trusted execution environment (TEE) hardware to blockchain platforms. By moving sensitive operations (e.g., data decryption and analysis) off of the blockchain and into a TEE, they get both the confidentiality of TEEs and the transparency of blockchains without the need to completely trust any one party in the data-sharing ecosystem.In this paper, we build on our TEE-enabled blockchain data-sharing system, Amanuensis, to ensure the freshness of access-control lists shared between the blockchain and TEE, and to improve the privacy of users interacting within the system. We also detail how TEE-based remote attestation help us to achieve information provenance - specifically, how to achieve information provenance in the context of the Intel SGX trusted execution environment. Finally, we present an evaluation of our system, in which we test several real-world machine-learning applications (logistic regression, kNN, SVM) to determine the run-time overhead of information confidentiality and provenance. Each machine-learning program exhibited a slowdown between 1.1 and 2.8x when run inside of our confidential environment, and took an average of 59 milliseconds to verify the provenance of an input data set. © 2022 IEEE.",,,Proceedings - International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140912077&doi=10.1109%2fICDCS54860.2022.00023&partnerID=40&md5=004b1de75ff7a2437d906a8e55579289,,Access control; Data privacy; Machine learning; Audit trails; Block-chain; Data confidentiality; Data Sharing; Data systems; Data users; Sensitive application; Trusted execution environments; Trusted party; User privacy; Blockchain,Conference Paper,Final,,2-s2.0-85140912077

These strategies aim not only regional planning, but also economic development and people’s quality of life. This refers to the concept of smart territories. To achieve their objectives, smart territories generally use citizens’ data to offer them services and support them in better individualized decision-making. However, a major problem arises in data management, as it is necessary to have the consent of users to access and use data. In this article, we propose a generic blockchain-based model for consent-based data sharing in the context of smart territories, while putting users at the center of control of their data. We take advantage of ADA-M (Automatable Discovery and Access Matrix), a matrix that provides a standardized way to unambiguously represent conditions related to discovery and access to data. We couple the use of ADA-M with a blockchain anchor system, which helps secure consent management for data access. This helps to develop an environment of digital trust for sharing data between users. Then, through a digital token, we offer a system of rewards for users in cases where their data is used for commercial purposes. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115263025&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-86162-9_26&partnerID=40&md5=bad226e2744f190c70ce3b24e16db32b,,,Conference Paper,Final,,2-s2.0-85115263025
,"Albalwy F., Brass A., Davies A.",A Blockchain-based dynamic consent architecture to support clinical genomic data sharing (ConsentChain): Proof-of-concept study,2021.0,Scopus,,,,,,,10.2196/27816,,,,,,,,,,,,"Background: In clinical genomics, sharing of rare genetic disease information between genetic databases and laboratories is essential to determine the pathogenic significance of variants to enable the diagnosis of rare genetic diseases. Significant concerns regarding data governance and security have reduced this sharing in practice. Blockchain could provide a secure method for sharing genomic data between involved parties and thus help overcome some of these issues. Objective: This study aims to contribute to the growing knowledge of the potential role of blockchain technology in supporting the sharing of clinical genomic data by describing blockchain-based dynamic consent architecture to support clinical genomic data sharing and provide a proof-of-concept implementation, called ConsentChain, for the architecture to explore its performance. Methods: The ConsentChain requirements were captured from a patient forum to identify security and consent concerns. The ConsentChain was developed on the Ethereum platform, in which smart contracts were used to model the actions of patients, who may provide or withdraw consent to share their data; the data creator, who collects and stores patient data; and the data requester, who needs to query and access the patient data. A detailed analysis was undertaken of the ConsentChain performance as a function of the number of transactions processed by the system. Results: We describe ConsentChain, a blockchain-based system that provides a web portal interface to support clinical genomic sharing. ConsentChain allows patients to grant or withdraw data requester access and allows data requesters to query and submit access to data stored in a secure off-chain database. We also developed an ontology model to represent patient consent elements into machine-readable codes to automate the consent and data access processes. Conclusions: Blockchains and smart contracts can provide an efficient and scalable mechanism to support dynamic consent functionality and address some of the barriers that inhibit genomic data sharing. However, they are not a complete answer, and a number of issues still need to be addressed before such systems can be deployed in practice, particularly in relation to verifying user credentials. © Faisal Albalwy, Andrew Brass, Angela Davies.

In 2018 the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force, committing companies to comply with lawful rules that stress their role and responsibilities in protecting the privacy of the legal persons that share personal data with them. In this paper we address the crucial challenges that companies face to achieve compliance with GDPR, and specifically to i) let data owners full visibility and control on the consents related to their own personal data, and ii) design services that can cope with consents that may change or be revoked dynamically. We propose a solution that relies on the blockchain technology to let data owners grant, access and rectify their consents in a decentralized peer-to-peer fashion, while guaranteeing consensual agreement of data owners and companies on the status of the relevant consents at any time. Although blockchains let all users access all contents freely, our solution suitably exploits encryption to both guarantee the integrity of the consents, and avoid any disclosure to third parties. At the company side, our approach settles a compliance broker that works in a publish-subscribe style to assist services in controlling their compliance to GDPR while the status of consents evolves on the blockchain. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

The data on the internet can be compromised and the performance can be bottlenecked. The solution to this problem is the blockchain technology. Reason for choosing this field is because blockchain is a new technology and now it is one of the most demanding field in the IT sector. Blockchain is based on peer-to-peer topology containing connected nodes. Each node has cryptographic hash of the previous node (no malicious or unauthorized node can enter the linked nodes), timestamp and relevant data. Blockchain provides resistance against the unwanted interference and modification of the data and each node has separate processing power thus enhancing security and performance of the host network. Permission-ed and Permission-less blockchain have their own properties and limitations and they can be used in different scenarios. In permission-less blockchain the nodes can be public, anyone can add nodes to increase the performance (Bitcoin), while permission-ed blockchain is used within enterprise or between enterprises where the nodes are private and new nodes need authorization to be added in link nodes. The aim of this paper is to study the permission-ed and permission less blockchain, their similarities and differences, some of the consensus algorithms they use. Outcome of the paper will be understanding of some of the consensus algorithms and proposing a two-tier architecture which will contain voting based algorithm for enhanced performance. © 2020 IEEE.",,,"CITISIA 2020 - IEEE Conference on Innovative Technologies in Intelligent Systems and Industrial Applications, Proceedings",2.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103029219&doi=10.1109%2fCITISIA50690.2020.9371832&partnerID=40&md5=c1d3d60a26ba1425ca05beb92b0c8144,Architecture; Blockchain; Consensus algorithm; Permission-ed; Permission-less,Computer architecture; Intelligent systems; Network architecture; Consensus algorithms; Internet technology; Link nodes; Peer-to-peer topology; Processing power; Security and performance; Two-tier architecture; Voting systems; Blockchain,Conference Paper,Final,,2-s2.0-85103029219

As an evolving field of medicine, e-Health involves the electronic processing of a patient's personal, medical and other health-related data to improve healthcare delivery. Data captured from clinical interactions between patients and their care providers, as well as health data collected through medical sensors, provide a rich source of data, known as patient medical records (PMRs), which can be processed in various ways to enhance the delivery of healthcare services. However, indiscriminate processing of PMRs could potentially result in the violation of the security or privacy of patients. To ensure that PMRs are not processed in ways that could be harmful to the security or privacy of the patients, modern data protection regulations, such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), requires healthcare service provides to obtain the consent of a patient for any processing operation on their PMRs. The mechanism by which a patient exercises their right to control who can process their PMRs, when and for what purpose, is referred to as consent management in e-Health. Existing health information technology systems do not provide adequate support for consent management; there is a lack of transparency and auditability in the existing systems to monitor and ensure that healthcare service providers comply to the relevant data protection regulations in processing PMRs. The emerging blockchain technology offers an opportunity to design an e-Health consent management system that is compliant with modern data protection regulations such as GDPR. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of an e-Health consent management framework, based on the state-of-the-art blockchain technologies, for processing PMRs.

,"Shi J., Li R., Hou W.",A Mechanism to Resolve the Unauthorized Access Vulnerability Caused by Permission Delegation in Blockchain-Based Access Control,2020.0,Scopus,,,,,,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3018783,,,,,,,,,,,,"Permission delegation in access control provides the subject with a second method to obtain object permissions in addition to permission granting. It is especially applicable when the owner and manager of the object are inconsistent. With the development of the Internet of Things, there are more and more scenes where object owners and managers are inconsistent, but the research on permission delegation in access control based on blockchain is not perfect. Therefore, once implemented in these blockchain-based access control algorithms, the permission delegation tends to have an unauthorized access. Based on the analysis of the causes for the unauthorized access vulnerability, this paper proposes a token-constrained permission delegation algorithm (TCPDA), which converts the access control policy corresponding to permissions into constraints for permission use, embeds the constraints in the permission token, and forms constraints on the transfer of tokens. Only subjects that meet the constraint conditions can receive tokens, thereby solving unauthorized access vulnerability caused by permission delegation. Since not all access control models can transform strategies into constraints and integrate them into blockchain tokens, this paper also proposes a permission delegation algorithm for decision-making entities to make desirable decisions. Finally, the security analysis shows that the two proposed schemes can overcome the unauthorized access vulnerability caused by permission delegation, and the algorithm performance is analyzed through experiments. © 2013 IEEE.",,,IEEE Access,4.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090950440&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2020.3018783&partnerID=40&md5=e60ee0581a0630495bc888014cde7b56,Access control; blockchain; permission delegation; unauthorized access vulnerability,Blockchain; Decision making; Managers; Access control models; Access control policies; Algorithm performance; Constraint conditions; Decision-making entities; Security analysis; Unauthorized access; Access control,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",2-s2.0-85090950440
,"Jaiman V., Urovi V.",A Consent Model for Blockchain-Based Health Data Sharing Platforms,2020.0,Scopus,,,,,,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3014565,,,,,,,,,,,,"In modern healthcare systems, the ability to share electronic health records is crucial for providing quality care and for enabling a larger spectrum of health services. Health data sharing is dependent on obtaining individual consent which, in turn, is hindered by a lack of resources. To this extent, blockchain-based platforms facilitate data sharing by creating a trusted distributed network of users. These users are enabled to share their data without depending on the time and resources of specific actors (such as the health services). In blockchain-based platforms, data governance mechanisms become very important due to the need to specify and monitor data sharing and data use conditions. In this article, we present a blockchain-based data-sharing consent model for access control over individual health data. We use smart contracts to dynamically represent the individual's consent over health data and to enable data requesters to search and access those data. The dynamic consent model extends to two ontologies: the Data Use Ontology (DUO) which models the individual consent of users and the Automatable Discovery and Access Matrix (ADA-M), which describes queries from data requesters. We deploy the model on Ethereum blockchain and evaluate different data sharing scenarios. The contribution of this article consists of the creation of an individual consent model for health data sharing platforms. Such a model guarantees that individual consent is respected and that all the participants in the data sharing platform are accountable. The evaluation of our solution indicates that such a data sharing model provides a flexible decision-making approach over data usage by data requesters. Our experimental evaluation shows that the proposed model is efficient and adapts to personalized access control policies in different data-sharing scenarios. © 2013 IEEE.",,,IEEE Access,42.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090267095&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2020.3014565&partnerID=40&md5=e243aadddf2d8dacccdfd444a54a60e8,Blockchain; data sharing; distributed ledgers; EHR exchange; individual consent,Access control; Blockchain; Decision making; Health; Monitoring; Ontology; Data governances; Data-sharing platforms; Distributed networks; Dynamic consents; Electronic health record; Experimental evaluation; Health-care system; Personalized access controls; Data Sharing,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",2-s2.0-85090267095

This requires a robust, trusted and flexible mechanism for patients to offer consent to share their data. Furthermore, new IT technologies make it easier to give patients more control over their data, including the right to revoke consent. These characteristics challenge the traditional paper-based, single-organisation-led consent process. The Dovetail digital consent application uses a mobile application and blockchain based infrastructure to offer this capability, as part of a pilot allowing patients to have their data shared amongst digital tools, empowering patients to manage their condition within an integrated care setting. Objective: To evaluate patient perceptions towards existing consent processes, and the Dovetail blockchain based digital consent application as a means to manage data sharing in the context of diabetes care. Method: Patients with diabetes at a General Practitioner practice were recruited. Data were collected using focus groups and questionnaires. Thematic analysis of the focus group transcripts and descriptive statistics of the questionnaires was performed. Results: There was a lack of understanding of existing consent processes in place, and many patients did not have any recollection of having previously given consent. The digital consent application received favourable feedback, with patients recognising the value of the capability offered by the application. Patients overwhelmingly favoured the digital consent application over existing practice. Conclusions: Digital consent was received favourably, with patients recognising that it addresses the main limitations of the current process. Feedback on potential improvements was received.

The provision of healthcare services and attempts to harness Big Data analytics are adversely affected by the fragmentation of medical data across healthcare providers.

We propose CrowdMed, a medical data management framework to facilitate greater data sharing, empowering patients with full control over access to their medical data. The framework is fully transparent, ensuring that patients have full knowledge over how who has access to their data, and how their data is being used. Using blockchain as the foundation for consent management, patients can trust that only parties with permission can view their data. Permissions are also finely specified, and can be revoked or modified according to the patient’s wishes. Following these permissions, data is transferred automatically between parties, conveniently and efficiently alleviating the problem of data fragmentation. CrowdMed also addresses the lack of motivation for data sharing, incentivising patients to share more of their data for research purposes through reward tokens and an innovative pricing mechanism.

,"Zhou T., Li X., Zhao H.",DLattice: A Permission-Less Blockchain Based on DPoS-BA-DAG Consensus for Data Tokenization,2019.0,Scopus,,,,,,,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2906637,,,,,,,,,,,,"In today's digital information age, the conflict between the public's growing awareness of their own data protection and the data owners' inability to obtain data ownership has become increasingly prominent. The emergence of blockchain provides a new direction for data protection and data tokenization. Nonetheless, existing cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin using Proof-of-Work are particularly energy intensive. On the other hand, classical protocols such as Byzantine agreement do not work efficiently in an open environment. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a permission-less blockchain with a novel double-DAG (directed acyclic graph) architecture called DLattice, where each account has its own Account-DAG and all accounts make up a greater Node-DAG structure. DLattice parallelizes the growth of each account's Account-DAG, each of which is not influenced by other accounts' irrelevant transactions. DLattice uses a new DPoS-BA-DAG(PANDA) protocol to reach consensus among users only when the forks are observed. Based on proposed DLattice, we introduce a process of data tokenization, including data assembling, data anchoring, and data authorization. We implement DLattice and evaluate its performance on 25 ECS virtual machines, simulating up to 500 nodes. The experimental results show that DLattice reaches a consensus in 10 seconds, achieves desired throughput, and incurs almost no penalty for scaling to more users. © 2013 IEEE.",,,IEEE Access,30.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065336696&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2019.2906637&partnerID=40&md5=d1e1e858756e00c0268cdeb97720a579,Blockchain; byzantine agreement protocols; consensus algorithm; data tokenization; directed acyclic graph,Directed graphs; Graph theory; Byzantine Agreement; Consensus algorithms; DAG structures; Data ownership; Digital information; Directed acyclic graph (DAG); Open environment; Tokenization; Blockchain,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",2-s2.0-85065336696

The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that has been recently put in force, sets the cornerstones regarding the collection and processing of personal data, for the benefit of Data Subjects and Controllers. However, applying this regulation to the IoT ecosystem is not a trivial task. This paper proposes ADvoCATE, a user-centric solution that allows data subjects to easily control consents regarding access to their personal data in the IoT ecosystem and exercise their rights defined by GDPR. It also assists Data Controllers and Processors to meet GDPR requirements. A blockchain infrastructure ensures the integrity of personal data processing consents, while the quality thereof is evaluated by an intelligence service.

The proposed system analyses packet-level data flows for building patterns of communications between IoT devices and external entities. To ensure non-repudiation, integrity and authentication of the data captured, they are stored in a Blockchain, a distributed ledger network, as digitally-signed transactions. Since the data can potentially include sensitive user information, it is imperative to promote trust by informing users about the operating principles of the network as well as to request the acceptance of a consent form by them.

While this classic method of granting consent is familiar to the parties involved, it involves little accountability or ongoing access oversight. Parents are asked to sign multiple permission forms, but are not given an efficient manner by which they can differentiate between fields for consent nor keep track of usage. Blockchain technology represents a promising approach for developing 'smart contracts', digital promises to be executed without reliance upon a legal intermediary. Utilizing Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Composer, we propose a framework of nested authorization, allowing a public school data administrator the ability to grant authorization rights to a third party afterschool intervention program and their volunteers, who meet with parents and obtain consent for data access rights relying on smart contracts. These data consent signatures allow researchers the ability to design targeted inventions, meeting the needs of the community. © 2018 IEEE.",,,"2018 International Conference on Computer Communication and Informatics, ICCCI 2018",16.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053499107&doi=10.1109%2fICCCI.2018.8441445&partnerID=40&md5=39bb88bd9055b4b70c3f749b97ec8ad8,Blockchain; Data consent; Data privacy; Smart contract,Blockchain; Public administration; Data administrators; Data consent; Intervention programs; Keep track of; Paper forms; Public schools; Smart contracts; Third parties; Data privacy,Conference Paper,Final,,2-s2.0-85053499107

In such an environment the average user is bound to face considerable difficulties in understanding the size and scope of his/her collected data. However, the provisions of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) require data subjects to be able to control their personal data, be informed and consent to its processing in an intelligible manner. This paper proposes ADVOCATE, a framework that facilitates GDPR-compliant processing of personal data in IoT environments. The present work aims to assist stakeholders, i.e. Data Controllers and Processors, satisfy GDPR requirements, such as informing data subjects in a transparent and unambiguous manner about the data they will manage, the processing purposes and periods. Respectively, data subjects will be promptly and comprehensively informed about any processing requests addressed to them, create and edit processing policies, exercise their rights in access, correction, deletion, restriction and opposition to data processing. Simultaneously, a notary service using blockchain infrastructures will ensure consents’ security and an intelligent service will inform data subjects about the quality of their consents.

,"Azaria A., Ekblaw A., Vieira T., Lippman A.",MedRec: Using blockchain for medical data access and permission management,2016.0,Scopus,,,,,,,10.1109/OBD.2016.11,,,,,,,,,,,,"Years of heavy regulation and bureaucratic inefficiency have slowed innovation for electronic medical records (EMRs). We now face a critical need for such innovation, as personalization and data science prompt patients to engage in the details of their healthcare and restore agency over their medical data. In this paper, we propose MedRec: a novel, decentralized record management system to handle EMRs, using blockchain technology. Our system gives patients a comprehensive, immutable log and easy access to their medical information across providers and treatment sites. Leveraging unique blockchain properties, MedRec manages authentication, confidentiality, accountability and data sharing - crucial considerations when handling sensitive information. A modular design integrates with providers' existing, local data storage solutions, facilitating interoperability and making our system convenient and adaptable. We incentivize medical stakeholders (researchers, public health authorities, etc.) to participate in the network as blockchain ""miners"". This provides them with access to aggregate, anonymized data as mining rewards, in return for sustaining and securing the network via Proof of Work. MedRec thus enables the emergence of data economics, supplying big data to empower researchers while engaging patients and providers in the choice to release metadata. The purpose of this short paper is to expose, prior to field tests, a working prototype through which we analyze and discuss our approach. © 2016 IEEE.",,,"Proceedings - 2016 2nd International Conference on Open and Big Data, OBD 2016",1302.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84991717011&doi=10.1109%2fOBD.2016.11&partnerID=40&md5=84b3e1526ec928063ea42daa8552b21a,access control; cryptographic protocols; distributed information systems; electronic medical records,Access control; Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; Electronic document exchange; Interoperability; Medical computing; Medical information systems; Patient treatment; Cryptographic protocols; Distributed information systems; Electronic medical record; Electronic medical records (EMRs); Medical information; Personalizations; Record management systems; Sensitive informations; Big data,Conference Paper,Final,,2-s2.0-84991717011
