However, authentication is the first line of defense in all these security parameters. Unfortunately, several authentication mechanisms in the traditional methods cannot provide secure communication due to various vulnerabilities such as single point of failure and privacy issues. Furthermore, key distribution mechanisms such as Certificate Authority (CA) and Trusted Third Party (TTP) distribute keys over the central architecture fail, thus secure communication cannot occur. As a solution to these drawbacks, this paper proposes a new decentralized blockchain-based identity authentication mechanism for VoIP networks, VoIPChain. The proposed scheme utilizes the main features of the blockchain platform, such as immutability, transparency, and fault tolerance, to provide data privacy and secure communication in VoIP applications. The proposed scheme is evaluated as an actual implementation using the virtual Ethereum platform and Python language. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme is an efficient and cost-effective solution for the call process as a decentralized identity authentication system in VoIP. In addition, end-to-end secure call performance outperforms the existing blockchain-based authentication mechanisms by 30%–70% in terms of average time delay. The proposed scheme is almost ten times faster than the TLS process to authenticate between parties. Moreover, compared to fast but less secure basic methods over the SIP authentication the proposed scheme has an acceptable time delay in a call process. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",,,Computer Communications,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144551871&doi=10.1016%2fj.comcom.2022.11.019&partnerID=40&md5=816b9fc2573b03583962413e76aa00ab,Authentication; Blockchain; Security; VoIP,Blockchain; Cost effectiveness; Cryptography; Data privacy; Fault tolerance; Internet protocols; Internet telephony; Network architecture; Peer to peer networks; Secure communication; Time delay; Voice/data communication systems; Authentication mechanisms; Block-chain; Call process; Decentralised; Identity authentication; Integrity authentications; Non repudiation; Security; Voice over IP; VoIP; Authentication,Article,Final,,2-s2.0-85144551871

The rise of self-sovereign identities (SSIs) based on blockchain technologies provides individuals with ownership and control over their personal data and allows them to share their data with others using a sort of “digital safe.” Fundamentally, people have the sole ownership of their identity data and control when and how it is shared, protecting their privacy. As these data need to be validated to be trusted, they may become a more important data source for digital information sharing and transactions than the formal source of identity controlled by governments. Furthermore, SSIs can be used for interacting digitally with any organization. These developments change the relationship between government, companies, and individuals. We explore information sharing and governance in the digital society using blockchain-based SSIs. In addition, the impact of SSIs on data storage in the digital world is assessed. Technology enactment might result in no greater control or privacy and might only reinforce current practices.

But there is not a clear consensus on how organisations perceive the value proposition of such technology, nor what might affect their adoption behaviour toward it. This research explains how technological, organisational and environmental (TOE) factors affect organisations’ adoption behaviour toward BDIDM. This study aims to determine the most critical factors affecting the behaviour while assessing the effectiveness and appropriateness of the model involved, i.e., TOE-BDIDM. Online questionnaires are used to survey 111 information and cybersecurity practitioners within South African organisations. The analysis combines binary logistic regression modelling, Structural Equation Modelling of the measurement model, and chi-squared tests. The results suggest TOE factors positively or negatively affect adoption behaviour. The behaviour is significantly affected by technology characteristics, i.e., BDIDM’s disruptive nature, and is associated with Blockchain type. Indeed, the majority of participants intended to recommend BDIDM to their organisations yet paradoxically preferred private-permissioned blockchain the most, revealing resistance to decentralised and privacy-preserving BDIDM models like Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). The latter might be utopian or unsustainable for organisations. TOE-BDIDM was found relatively appropriate and effective but arguably ‘incomplete’ for explaining the adoption of disruptive technologies like SSI in organisations.

In essence, multi-party agreement signing (MPAS) can be reckoned as a special case of the multi-party fair exchange (MPFE) for signatures over a digital agreement. However, such general MPAS protocols have not seen wide adoptions in practice, possibly due to the lack of incentives to maintain the signing platform. Practically, monetary-incentivized enterprises exist to act as a trusted third party (TTP) and provide signing services. However, such an agreement signing flow still suffers from certain limitations in terms of insecure and inefficient operations. To this end, we propose a secure and efficient framework for multi-party agreement signing based on decentralized identity, blockchain and decentralized storage network (DSN). The framework consists of two subsystems where the identity subsystem contains an extensible three-tier user identity model atop decentralized identity, and the agreement signing subsystem, empowered by the identity subsystem, DSN and several novel designs, achieves security and efficiency design goals. For the convenience of explanation, we suppose that a centralized signing service provider (SSP) is properly involved, i.e., sensitive information is still protected against the SSP, and acts as a TTP to ensure the crucial properties such as fairness and coordinate the signing activities. Our design is also compatible with other methods, e.g., ensuring fairness via blockchain, which removes the single point of failure of SSP. We prototype the framework and the performance evaluation shows effectiveness and efficiency. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",,,Communications in Computer and Information Science,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85145258099&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-19-8043-5_1&partnerID=40&md5=0e27576ce8bbda3195db0fb9a12dea2a,Agreement signing; Blockchain; Decentralized identity; Decentralized storage networks; Self-sovereign identity,Efficiency; Network security; Agreement signing; Block-chain; Decentralised; Decentralized identity; Decentralized storage network; Self-sovereign identity; Service provider; Storage networks; Trusted third parties; Blockchain,Conference Paper,Final,,2-s2.0-85145258099

With this rapid expansion, it faces some major hurdles in data secrecy, privacy, and device integrity, and perhaps, in general, digital identity has been a major problem on the internet. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has provided a standardized format through which one can specify his identity called Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs). Blockchain technology, alongside decentralized identifiers and public-key cryptography, offers a peer-to-peer identity and credential management model through self-sovereign identity. Combining the decentralized identity and blockchains provides us with verifiable credentials through which one can verify the identities of transacting peers by decentralized registration and discovery of public keys needed to verify digital signatures. This combined framework is trusted, permissioned, supports device registration and verification along with revocation of device credentials, is secure, respects the privacy of the participating nodes, and maintains the integrity of their data. With several new communication protocols being developed for IoT and leveraging the Blockchain protocols in the domain of IoT, this paper quantitatively compares the performance of the well-known IoT communication protocols such as CoAP, MQTT, and DIDComm in real-time testbed on various parameters, and the results are tabulated.

As a result, linking or aggregating a complete record for a patient is a major technological, legal, and operational challenge. One of the factors that has made clinical data integration so difficult to achieve is the lack of a universal ID for everyone. This leads to other related problems of having to prove identity at each interaction with the health system and repeatedly providing basic information on demographics, insurance, payment, and medical conditions. Traditional solutions that require complex governance, expensive technology, and risks to privacy and security of the data have failed adequately to solve this interoperability problem. We describe the technical design decisions of a patient-centric decentralized health identity management system using the blockchain technology, called MediLinker, to address some of these challenges. Design: Our multidisciplinary research group developed and implemented an identity wallet, which uses the blockchain technology to manage verifiable credentials issued by healthcare clinics, banks, and insurance com-panies. To manage patient’s self-sovereign identity, we leveraged the Hyperledger Indy blockchain framework to store patient’s decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and the schemas or format for each credential type. In con-trast, the credentials containing patient data are stored ‘off-ledger’ in each person’s wallet and accessible via a computer or smartphone. We used Hyperledger Aries as a middleware layer (API: Application Programming Interface) to connect Hyperledger Indy with the front-end, which was developed using a JavaScript frame-work, ReactJS (Web Application) and React Native (iOS Application). Results: MediLinker allows users to store their personal data on digital wallets, which they control. It uses a decentralized trusted identity using Hyperledger Indy and Hyperledger Aries. Patients use MediLinker to register and share their information securely and in a trusted system with healthcare and other service provid-ers. Each MediLinker wallet can have six credential types: health ID with patient demographics, insurance, medication list including COVID-19 vaccination status, credit card, medical power of attorney (MPOA) for guardians of pediatric or geriatric patients, and research consent. The system allows for in-person and remote granting and revoking of such permissions for care, research, or other purposes without repeatedly requiring physical identity documents or enrollment information. Conclusion: We successfully developed and tested a blockchain-based technical architecture, described in this article, as an identity management system that may be operationalized and scaled for future implementation to improve patient experience and control over their personal information. © 2022, Partners in Digital Health.

A secure, privacy-preserving, and efficient identity solution is essential but challenging. This paper examines the current literature and provides a systematic literature review in three stages based on the three research questions (RQ) that show the assessment and interpretation process step by step. Based on the parameters and RQ specified in the research methodology section, a total of 43 primary articles have been selected from the 251 articles extracted from various scientific databases. The majority of these articles are concerned with evaluating the existing self-sovereign identity (SSI) solutions and their role in the blockchain-based land registry system to address the compliance issues in the existing SSI solutions with SSI principles and find the best possible SSI solution to address the identity problems in the land registry. The existing digital identity solutions cannot handle the requirements of the identity principle and are prone to various limitations like centralization and dependency on third parties that further augment the chance of security threats. SSI has been designed to overcome these limitations and provide a secure, reliable, and efficient identity solution that gives complete control to the users over their personal identity information (PII). This paper reviews the existing SSI solutions, evaluates them based on the SSI principles, and comes up with the best possible SSI solution for a blockchain-based land registry system. It further provides a detailed investigation of each SSI solution to present its functionalities and limitations for further improvement. © 2022 Mohammed Shuaib et al.",,,Mobile Information Systems,11.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128769755&doi=10.1155%2f2022%2f8930472&partnerID=40&md5=1d748a625643baf0b3603256727f32d8,,Electronic document identification systems; Privacy-preserving techniques; 'current; Block-chain; Digital identity; Land registries; Privacy preserving; Process steps; Research methodologies; Research questions; Scientific database; Systematic literature review; Blockchain,Review,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",2-s2.0-85128769755

These systems have failed to safeguard user data privacy and do not encourage the portability of identity data. Self-sovereign identity is a new approach in identity management where entities have control of their digital identity. The emerging blockchain technology enables self-sovereign identity management, a decentralized identity management model that eliminates identity providers as a trusted third party. Due to the decentralized nature of blockchain network, this new paradigm of identity management demands different trust requirements. This research provides the first thorough review in literature addressing trust management for blockchain-based self-sovereign identity. A formal and comprehensive trust model proposed for blockchain-based Self-Sovereign IDM will be explored. Besides reviewing trust requirements, the paper also surveys the state-of-the-art of blockchain technology for self-sovereignty in identity management. This survey provides a critical analysis for existing research which sheds light on various opportunities for enhancing security and privacy of blockchain-based self-sovereign identity management and the improvement of trust management.

Public key infrastructure (PKI) is a technology to solve cross-domain authentication. However, there are problems such as difficulty in mutual trust between multiple certificate authority nodes (CA), failure of single point, and low efficiency in the traditional PKI method. Blockchain is a promising technology for decentralized trust management by providing consistent data storage, which gives impetus to the further development of cross-domain identity authentication. Thus, this article apply blockchain to cross-domain identity authentication. To solve the defects of the traditional PKI method, the design requirements are analyzed firstly, based on the analysis result, we proposed a double-layer cross-domain identity authentication model by constructing a consortium blockchain which is comprised of authentication server nodes (AS) and some internal blockchain, the model can highly improve the scalability of the PKI system without changing the internal architecture. Then a novel authentication protocol was put forward. The protocol can improve the efficiency of online cross-domain identity authentication transactions by verifying the hash instead of the signature of their certificate. By putting the generation process of the blockchain certificate and the storage process of its hash in the registration operation and reducing the authentication process for AS and CA, the efficiency is further improved. Finally, the protocol was evaluated by security and performance analysis. The results display our protocol can guarantee security and has an excellent performance in cross-domain identity authentication transactions. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,Transactions on Emerging Telecommunications Technologies,1.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117383825&doi=10.1002%2fett.4377&partnerID=40&md5=100aa7f8a10b72a78ea4d9d6fb16f350,,Authentication; Digital storage; Efficiency; Information management; Network architecture; Public key cryptography; Authentication servers; Block-chain; Certificate authority; Cross-domain; Decentralised; Identity authentication; Identity authentication protocol; Protocol cans; Public key infrastructure; Server nodes; Blockchain,Article,Final,,2-s2.0-85117383825

In this paper, we are building a self-sovereign identity management system using blockchain (BSelSovID). The application will serve as an interface to all the entities involved, viz. user, authority, and verifier. The use of blockchain is to dodge the centralized identity manager. The user gets digital identity after getting authority’s verifiable claim and the identity is stored on interplanetary file system (IPFS) and the content address of these is stored on the blockchain. This makes it easy for the user to interact with different services without having identity for each one of them. The security of user data is ensured by encrypting the data and giving user the complete control over his data stored in the IPFS. The blockchain cannot extract the user’s data but can only request the user to provide some data attribute or some verification as the verifier demands. Thus, the system provides security and privacy to users’ data as well as user has control over his data. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",,,Lecture Notes on Data Engineering and Communications Technologies,2.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116871259&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-16-3961-6_31&partnerID=40&md5=c03479f0b36fe020dd5b2a1f94fae968,Blockchain; Cryptography; Digital identity; Privacy; Security,Authentication; Blockchain; Data privacy; Electronic document identification systems; Block-chain; Centralised; Current technology; Digital identity; Filesystem; Identity management systems; New applications; Privacy; Security; User data; Cryptography,Book Chapter,Final,,2-s2.0-85116871259

The pandemic has been a true catalyst for remote eHealth solutions such as teleHealth. Telehealth facilitates care, diagnoses, and treatment remotely, making them more efficient, accessible, and economical. However, they have a centralized identity management system that restricts the interoperability of patient and healthcare provider identification. Thus, creating silos of users that are unable to authenticate themselves beyond their eHealth application’s domain. Furthermore, the consumers of remote eHealth applications are forced to trust their service providers completely. They cannot check whether their eHealth service providers adhere to the regulations to ensure the security and privacy of their identity information. Therefore, we present a blockchain-based decentralized identity management system that allows patients and healthcare providers to identify and authenticate themselves transparently and securely across different eHealth domains. Patients and healthcare providers are uniquely identified by their health identifiers (healthIDs). The identity attributes are attested by a healthcare regulator, indexed on the blockchain, and stored by the identity owner.

In this paper, we describe an architecture and set of protocols for distributed identity management across permissioned blockchain networks to establish a trust basis for data sharing. Networks wishing to interoperate can associate with one or more distributed identity registries that maintain credentials on shared ledgers managed by groups of reputed identity providers. A network's participants possess self-sovereign decentralized identities (DIDs) on these registries and can obtain privacy-preserving verifiable membership credentials. During interoperation, networks can securely and dynamically discover each others' latest membership lists and members' credentials.

Usually, the problem that identity authentication is prone to is that the user name and password are transmitted in the network in plaintext. The security is not enough, and it is very vulnerable to replay attacks and dictionary attacks. Dynamic passwords Although authentication is more secure, if there is a problem with the time synchronization between the server and the client, the user will not be able to login for a long time. Moreover, the password of the dynamic password is the same within a period of time, and it is also vulnerable to replay attacks.

In the proposed platform, the DID and a credential represent an user's digital identity. We define DID chaincode and credential protocol to cover the full lifecycle of a user's digital identity. We build a complete consortium blockchain and application environment, and implement a prototype as an App for Android-based phones.

However, as the continuous development of smart tourism industry, various types of dishonest even illegal behavior have gradually emerged. Due to the absence of an effective identity authentication mechanism for the travel services provider, there are illegal travel agencies, unqualified part-time tour guides, etc., thereby harming the rights and interests of tourist. Considering the above problems, this paper proposes a smart tourism identity authentication service based on blockchain and Decentralized Identifier (DID). The service requester can verify the attributes of the DID, and then check the certificate. By exploiting the collaborative management of on-chain and off-chain data, the entire process of smart tourism service identity authentication is safe, reliable and traceable. In order to alleviate the storage pressure of blockchain, the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is introduced to store DID document and Verifiable Credential certificate. The simulation experiments demonstrated that the proposed identity authentication system is both available and effective. The purpose of this paper is to help customers improve their identification ability, and promote the comprehensive and sustainable development of smart tourism. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",,,Communications in Computer and Information Science,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121771845&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-16-7993-3_42&partnerID=40&md5=37b6659cb892468b9cd934b4351ffd59,Blockchain; DID; Identity authentication; IPFS; Smart tourism,Authentication; Crime; Digital storage; Authentication services; Block-chain; Decentralised; Decentralized identifier; Filesystem; Identity authentication; Interplanetary file system; Service-based; Smart tourism; Tourism industry; Blockchain,Conference Paper,Final,,2-s2.0-85121771845

This solution brings together advances from the fields of identity management, confidential computing, and advanced data usage control. In the area of identity management, the solution is aligned with emerging decentralized identity standards: Decentralized identifiers (DIDs), DID communication and verifiable credentials (VCs). In respect to confidential computing, the Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme is incorporated with the system to protect the privacy of the individual's data and prevent unauthorized secondary use when being shared with potential users. In the area of advanced data usage control, the solution leverages the PRIV-DRM solution architecture to derive a novel approach to licensing of data usage to prevent unauthorized secondary usage of data held by individuals. Specifically, our design covers necessary roles in the data-sharing ecosystem: The issuer of personal data, the individual holder of the personal data (i.e., the data subject), a trusted data storage manager, a trusted license distributor, and the data consumer. The proof-of-concept implementation utilizes the decentralized identity framework being developed by the Hyperledger Indy/Aries project.

AttriChain realizes on-chain access control and distributed identity governance by allowing users to create transactions anonymously using their transaction keys and their attributes. It provides unlinkability and anonymity of transactions belonging to legitimate users whereas provides accountability for those whom other members in the network regard as questionable or malicious. The design of threshold traceability of anonymous transactions allows network members to trace transactions back to the sender without violating the decentralized property of blockchain. In AttriChain, the spontaneous tracing of misbehaviors in the network distributes the power of identity governance to multiple independent tracing members instead of depending on single-point management.

However, the majority of customers are reluctant to use the open banking service, because they feel unsafe to share data with third-party service providers. In this paper, we proposed (BBM) a blockchain-based self-sovereign identity system model for open banking. The model provides a reliable secured communication network between users and third-party service providers and enables users to control their own identities and data. Through a comparison with the existing related work, the superiority of the BBM model has been demonstrated and analysed. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),5.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092086282&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-59638-5_5&partnerID=40&md5=935155622349a7795335dc651df9d0d2,Blockchain; Open banking; Self-sovereign identity,Banking; Blockchain; Fintech; Banking services; Banking technologies; Investment returns; Related works; Secured communication; System modeling; Third-party service providers; Data Sharing,Conference Paper,Final,,2-s2.0-85092086282

On one hand, collecting relevant data can help clinicians, specialists and healthcare service providers to facilitate care for patients. On the other hand, Self-Sovereign identity and the right to control personal data comes into question, because patients do not handle their data explicitly. Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is a novel method which would allow to securely record time-stamped data and enable patient-driven health and identity records. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art in Blockchain (BC)-based self-sovereignty and patient data records in healthcare. Our motivation is to investigate the potential of BC technology for use in the patient data and identity management. As a distributed decentralized technology, BC can be very beneficial, giving patients control over their own data and self-sovereign identity. To the extent of our knowledge, there is no literature covering the same concerns. More specifically, the focus is on solutions that aim the realization of holistic BC-based Electronic Health Records (EHR) and Patient Health Records (PHR). EHR and PHR are used to record patient data, such as the doctor's notes upon a visit and radiology images. Hence, they include critical information regarding patient's privacy and identity. Therefore, development of pure decentralized Healthcare Information Systems (HIS) is a great challenge in terms of architectural and technical structure of the systems. Designing robust and reliable EHR and PHR, which represent the foundation of many other healthcare services, relies on carefully finding the balance in a trade-off between many factors, such as level of decentralization, privacy, scalability and data throughput. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art and provide an analysis on the design trade-offs. © 2013 IEEE.",,,IEEE Access,52.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085549368&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2020.2994090&partnerID=40&md5=31db36c628d2738a9065076026cda855,Blockchain; Healthcare; Privacy; Self-sovereignty,Blockchain; Economic and social effects; Electronic document identification systems; Health care; Hospital data processing; Design tradeoff; Digital identity; Electronic health record; Healthcare information systems (HIS); Healthcare services; Identity management; State of the art; Technical structures; Medical computing,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",2-s2.0-85085549368

In this way we aren’t having control on our own identity. Consequently security of identity is becoming very serious issue, it becomes more hard to authorize a level of trust between multiple parties. On this issue Sovereign Identity will be the best solution. Sovereign means Unrestricted. There is no restriction on our identity and it will be completely under the control of the user.

However, some of the user's identity credentials used as the basis of trust on these payment technologies may be changing over time, which could largely complicate or confuse the retrospective verifications. In this paper, we propose a self-sovereign dynamic digital identity scheme to address the above problem. We introduce the management and use of dynamic digital identity, which is created using the blockchain technology. The proposed scheme makes use of a combination of biometric traits and other identity attributes that could vary or evolve over time. Since the proposed dynamic identity allows tracing back to a previous version of the identity of the same individual via the blockchain, it can be used to retrospectively verify a previous transaction associated with a previous version of the identity. © 2019 IEEE.",,,Conference Proceedings - IEEE SOUTHEASTCON,3.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082396489&doi=10.1109%2fSoutheastCon42311.2019.9020518&partnerID=40&md5=6c0a78c4c5ca86781e055875ddda5703,blockchain; digital identity; dynamic identity,Electronic document identification systems; Biometric traits; Digital identity; Dynamic identities; Identity theft; Blockchain,Conference Paper,Final,,2-s2.0-85082396489

There are a few works in the literature which examine different aspects of self-sovereign identity. Unfortunately, the existing works are not methodological and comprehensive at all. Moreover, there exist different notions of what the term self-sovereign identity means. To exploit its full potential, it is essential to ensure a common understanding in a formal way. This paper aims to achieve this goal by providing the first-ever formal and rigorous treatment of the concept of self-sovereign identity using a mathematical model. This paper examines the properties that a self-sovereign identity should have and explores the impact of self-sovereign identity over the laws of identity. It also highlights the essential life-cycles of an identity management system and inter-relates how the notion of self-sovereign identity can be applied in these life-cycles. In addition, the paper illustrates several envisioned flows involving a self-sovereign identity leveraging blockchain technology covering different aspects of an identity management system.

In this paper, a framework, named EverSSDI, using smart contracts in an Ethereum-based blockchain is constructed, which provides a unique identifier to normalise differentiated user identities. A finegrained authorisation mechanism is designed based on the Hierarchical Deterministic protocol (HD protocol) to solve the fragmentation problem of identity information. Besides, a reliable information verification mechanism is elaborated to enhance the credibility of the digital information. In addition, two novel methods are proposed for identity recovery, one of which is based on Social Networking Services (SNS) authorisation and the other Ethereum Oracles. The final implementation and discussion show that the user has self-sovereign management authority, which enables the user to become the real dominant of his/her identity rather than only a prover of digital identity. © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",,,International Journal of Computer Applications in Technology,15.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068063921&doi=10.1504%2fIJCAT.2019.100300&partnerID=40&md5=2d903363cef1da1d4d8e01cf36de6355,Blockchain; Decentralisation; Digital identity; Ethereum; Hierarchical deterministic protocol; IPFS; Self-sovereign; Smart contract,Electronic document identification systems; Ethereum; Decentralisation; Deterministic protocols; Digital identity; IPFS; Self-sovereign; Blockchain,Article,Final,,2-s2.0-85068063921

To provide identity within the context of mutual distrust, this paper presents a blockchain-based digital identity solution. Without depending upon a single trusted third party, the proposed solution achieves passport-level legally valid identity. This solution for making identities Self-Sovereign, builds on a generic provable claim model for which attestations of truth from third parties need to be collected. The claim model is then shown to be both blockchain structure and proof method agnostic. Four different implementations in support of these two claim model properties are shown to offer sub-second performance for claim creation and claim verification.
