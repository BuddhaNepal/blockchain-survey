However, current approaches are moving away from centralized orchestration toward a decentralized one in order to fully adapt FL for a cross-silo configuration with multiple organizations acting as clients. State-of-the-art decentralized FL mechanisms make at least one of the following assumptions: 1) clients are trusted organizations and cannot inject low-quality model updates for aggregation and 2) client local models can be shared with other clients or a third party for verification of low-quality updates. This article proposes a Blockchain-based decentralized framework for scenarios where participatory organizations are believed to be fully capable of injecting low-quality model updates as they are not willing to expose their local models to any other entity for verification purpose. The proposed decentralized FL framework adopts a novel hierarchical network of aggregators with the ability to punish/reward organizations in proportion to their local model quality updates. The framework is flexible and unlike state-of-the-art solutions, prevents a single entity from possessing the aggregated model in any FL round of training. The proposed framework is tested with respect to off-chain and on-chain performance in two Industry 4.0 use cases: 1) predictive maintenance and 2) product visual inspection. A comparative evaluation against the state-of-the-art reveals the proposed framework's utility in terms of minimizing model convergence time and latency while maximizing accuracy and throughput. © 2014 IEEE.",,,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141626824&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2022.3218704&partnerID=40&md5=35a4d9ede3be74bae212abf3bc734a3d,Blockchain; federated learning (FL); industry 4.0,Client server computer systems; Industry 4.0; Block-chain; Computational modelling; Decentralised; Federated learning; Fourth industrial revolution; Industrial revolutions; Low qualities; Predictive models; State of the art; Blockchain,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",2-s2.0-85141626824

Generally, this mechanism uses blockchain technology to supervise the original data and calculation results, which ignores the supervision of the Federated Learning model and computing process. Therefore, we introduce the concepts of the sandbox and state channel to construct a new data privacy sharing paradigm via Blockchain and Federated Learning. Under this paradigm, we use state channel to connect Blockchain and Federated Learning. And state channel is used to create a 'trusted sandbox' to instantiate Federated Learning tasks in the trustless edge computing environment.

When it comes to determining the identity of COVID-19, one of the most significant obstacles that researchers must overcome is the rapid propagation of the virus, in addition to the dearth of trustworthy testing models. This problem continues to be the most difficult one for clinicians to deal with. The use of AI in image processing has made the formerly insurmountable challenge of finding COVID-19 situations more manageable. In the real world, there is a problem that has to be handled about the difficulties of sharing data between hospitals while still honoring the privacy concerns of the organizations. When training a global deep learning (DL) model, it is crucial to handle fundamental concerns such as user privacy and collaborative model development. For this study, a novel framework is designed that compiles information from five different databases (several hospitals) and edifies a global model using blockchain-based federated learning (FL). The data is validated through the use of blockchain technology (BCT), and FL trains the model on a global scale while maintaining the secrecy of the organizations. The proposed framework is divided into three parts. First, we provide a method of data normalization that can handle the diversity of data collected from five different sources using several computed tomography (CT) scanners. Second, to categorize COVID-19 patients, we ensemble the capsule network (CapsNet) with incremental extreme learning machines (IELMs). Thirdly, we provide a strategy for interactively training a global model using BCT and FL while maintaining anonymity. Extensive tests employing chest CT scans and a comparison of the classification performance of the proposed model to that of five DL algorithms for predicting COVID-19, while protecting the privacy of the data for a variety of users, were undertaken. Our findings indicate improved effectiveness in identifying COVID-19 patients and achieved an accuracy of 98.99%.

However, current IoT paradigms rely on centralized storage and computing to operate the DL algorithms. This key central component can potentially cause issues in scalability, security threats, and privacy breaches. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a new paradigm for DL algorithms to preserve data privacy.

However, with the traditional AI approach, users sharing their raw data causes many concerns in terms of privacy leakage. There have been reports that there are privacy violations on private data of users. In the medical field, the creation of devices to help automatically diagnose the user's disease is gradually becoming a trend in the future. These devices help users monitor their own health, thereby reducing pressure on medical facilities that are often overloaded. However, the healthcare data of individuals will often be very sensitive and rarely shared by users. In addition, the profits generated from machine learning (ML) models mostly belong to the owners of that model. It also becomes an obstacle in encouraging users to share their data. In this article, we propose PriFL-Chain, a privacy-preservation framework to take advantage of data resources of data owners for training ML-based models, while ensuring the privacy of data owners. Specifically, we apply Differential privacy (DP) to federated learning (FL) to train ML models. Users just share the ML model trained on their data instead of sharing the raw data. Furthermore, the contribution activities of users in the system are recorded to the Blockchain to ensure transparency. We also leverage Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to reduce the pressure on the central server and reduce data communication costs, making the system more flexible.

Opposite to centralized intelligence, Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) relieves overwhelmed communication overhead and enjoys the advantages of high bandwidth as well as abundant computing resources while retaining privacy-preserving benefits of Federated Learning (FL). It is difficult to balance system overhead and model performance in the HFL framework, while it could be solved by introducing an incentive mechanism. Although the incentive mechanism can alleviate the above anxiety by compensating relevant participants, some limitations (multi-dimensional properties, incomplete information and unreliable participants) will significantly degrade the performance and efficiency of the designed mechanism. To address the challenges caused by the above limitations, we propose InFEDge, a blockchain-based incentive mechanism in the HFL. The InFEDge considers 1) multi-dimensional individual properties to model system participants and proves the uniqueness of Nash equilibrium with the closed-form solution.

,"Cui L., Su X., Zhou Y.",A Fast Blockchain-Based Federated Learning Framework With Compressed Communications,2022.0,Scopus,,,,,,,10.1109/JSAC.2022.3213345,,,,,,,,,,,,"Recently, blockchain-based federated learning (BFL) has attracted intensive research attention due to that the training process is auditable and the architecture is serverless avoiding the single point failure of the parameter server in vanilla federated learning (VFL). Nevertheless, BFL tremendously escalates the communication traffic volume because all local model updates (i.e., changes of model parameters) obtained by BFL clients will be transmitted to all miners for verification and to all clients for aggregation. In contrast, the parameter server and clients in VFL only retain aggregated model updates. Consequently, the huge communication traffic in BFL will inevitably impair the training efficiency and hinder the deployment of BFL in reality. To improve the practicality of BFL, we are among the first to propose a fast blockchain-based communication-efficient federated learning framework by compressing communications in BFL, called BCFL. Meanwhile, we derive the convergence rate of BCFL with non-convex loss. To maximize the final model accuracy, we further formulate the problem to minimize the training loss of the convergence rate subject to a limited training time with respect to the compression rate and the block generation rate, which is a bi-convex optimization problem and can be efficiently solved. To the end, to demonstrate the efficiency of BCFL, we carry out extensive experiments with standard CIFAR-10 and FEMNIST datasets. Our experimental results not only verify the correctness of our analysis, but also manifest that BCFL can remarkably reduce the communication traffic by 95-98% or shorten the training time by 90-95% compared with BFL. © 1983-2012 IEEE.",,,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,1.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140713410&doi=10.1109%2fJSAC.2022.3213345&partnerID=40&md5=a8f897479ec1edbbf9b2e3effc33f00a,blockchain; compression; convergence; Federated learning,Convex optimization; Efficiency; Learning systems; Block-chain; Compression; Computational modelling; Convergence; Federated learning; Learning frameworks; Load modeling; Blockchain,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",2-s2.0-85140713410

In this system model, distributed mobile devices (MDs) communicate with a set of edge servers (ESs) to handle both machine learning (ML) model training and block mining simultaneously. To assist the ML model training for resource-constrained MDs, we develop an offloading strategy that enables MDs to transmit their data to one of the associated ESs. We then propose a new decentralized ML model aggregation solution at the edge layer based on a consensus mechanism to build a global ML model via peer-to-peer (P2P)-based blockchain communications. Blockchain builds trust among MDs and ESs to facilitate reliable ML model sharing and cooperative consensus formation, and enables rapid elimination of manipulated models caused by poisoning attacks. We formulate latency-aware BFL as an optimization aiming to minimize the system latency via joint consideration of the data offloading decisions, MDs' transmit power, channel bandwidth allocation for MDs' data offloading, MDs' computational allocation, and hash power allocation. Given the mixed action space of discrete offloading and continuous allocation variables, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning scheme with a parameterized advantage actor critic algorithm. We theoretically characterize the convergence properties of BFL in terms of the aggregation delay, mini-batch size, and number of P2P communication rounds.

By training models locally at each client and aggregating learning models at a central server, FL has the capability to avoid sharing data directly, thereby reducing privacy leakage. However, the conventional FL framework relies heavily on a single central server, and it may fail if such a server behaves maliciously. To address this single point of failure, in this work, a blockchain-assisted decentralized FL framework is investigated, which can prevent malicious clients from poisoning the learning process, and thus provides a self-motivated and reliable learning environment for clients. In this framework, the model aggregation process is fully decentralized and the tasks of training for FL and mining for blockchain are integrated into each participant. Privacy and resource-allocation issues are further investigated in the proposed framework, and a critical and unique issue inherent in the proposed framework is disclosed. In particular, a lazy client can simply duplicate models shared by other clients to reap benefits without contributing its resources to FL. To address these issues, analytical and experimental results are provided to shed light on possible solutions, i.e., adding noise to achieve local differential privacy and using pseudo-noise (PN) sequences as watermarks to detect lazy clients. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",,,IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine,7.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135330141&doi=10.1109%2fMCI.2022.3180932&partnerID=40&md5=b238a7bb3b467fc72fc0ee2eacfa62c2,,Computer aided instruction; Data privacy; Learning systems; Block-chain; Central servers; Computing capability; Decentralised; Distributed learning; Distributed machine learning; End-user equipments; Learning frameworks; Learning paradigms; Privacy concerns; Blockchain,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",2-s2.0-85135330141

Bift enables distributed CAVs to train ML models locally using their own driving data and then to upload the local models to get a better global model.

Current FL approaches operate in an iterative manner by selecting a subset of participants each round, asking them to training using their latest local data over the most recent version of the global model, before collecting these local model updates and aggregating them to form the next iteration of the global model, and so forth until convergence is reached. Unfortunately, existing FL approaches typically select randomly the set of clients to use each round, which can negatively impact the quality of the model trained, as well the training round time due to the straggler problem. Moreover, clients, especially mobile devices with limited resources, should be incentivized to participate as federated learning is essentially a form of crowdsourcing for AI which requires monetization. We argue that the integration of blockchain and smart contract technologies to FL can solve the two aforementioned issues. In this paper, we present FL-MAB (FL- Multi-Auction using Blockchain), a client selection mechanism for FL operating in a smart contract which rewards clients for their participation using cryptocurrencies. FL-MAB employs a multidimensional auction mechanism for selecting users based on the compute and network resources offered by each client, as well as the quality of their local data. This auction is realized in a reliable and auditable manner through a smart contract.

Energy sharing allows exchanging energy between the categories of consumers and prosumers in return for future benefits. FederatedGrids platform uses blockchain and federated learning to enable autonomous activities while providing trust and privacy among all participants. Indeed, based on various smart contracts using federated learning, FederatedGrids calculates a prediction of the future energy production and demand allowing the system to autonomously switch between trading and sharing, and enabling the prosumers to make decisions related to their participation in the energy sharing process. Up to our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to create a hybrid energy trading and sharing platform, with the real sharing meaning, and that uses federated learning over the smart contract for energy demand prediction.

Selecting participants by storing and querying the metadata of data owners on blockchain could ensure the reliability of selected data owners, which is helpful to obtain high-quality models in FL. However, querying multi-dimensional metadata on blockchain needs to traverse every transaction in each block, making the query time-consuming.

Further, the traditional FL cannot allow the distributed model sharing among untrusted devices which results in low training efficiency on devices. Blockchain is a promising approach to address the above issues since it can establish a secure decentralized and transaction sharing environment for untrusted devices. In this paper, we integrate blockchain into FL to build a distributed model training and sharing platform, where distributed mobile devices execute local model training and base stations maintain blockchain-based model sharing. Moreover, in order to accelerate the establishment of blockchain, we design a lightweight consensus strategy based on a delegate committee. To select high-quality nodes to form delegate committee, we design a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based selection algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve a higher precision compared with the traditional FL, and the proposed DRL selection algorithm can reduce consensus latency compared with the benchmarks. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,International Journal of Communication Systems,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139913682&doi=10.1002%2fdac.5367&partnerID=40&md5=dbc12564404ae442b44658a04a2e7c96,6G; Blockchain; delegate selection; federated learning,Base stations; Data privacy; Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Mobile security; Network security; Queueing networks; Reinforcement learning; 6g; Block-chain; Delegate selection; Distributed models; Federated learning; Machine-learning; Model sharing; Model training; Reinforcement learnings; Selection algorithm; Blockchain,Article,Article in Press,,2-s2.0-85139913682

The procedure of exchanging medical information is increasingly concerned with data privacy. Many techniques have been offered for preserving data security. These techniques use approaches such as (Formula presented.) -anonymity, (Formula presented.) -diversity, and others. However, such solutions are vulnerable to attribute disclosure, homogeneity, and background knowledge risks due to their syntactic nature. In this work, we describe a safe and secure architecture and semantic approach for data sharing that is based on blockchain, local differential privacy (LDP), and federated learning (FL). The proposed framework generates an atmosphere devoid of trust in which data owners are no longer required to have trust in the controllers. The FL models enable the whole network to decentralize its data-driven learning. Interplanetary file system (IPFS) is used to provide data security in a distributed environment because each file in IPFS has a digital fingerprint that is computed using a cryptographic hash function on the file's whole contents. Due to the rigorous privacy guarantee, data owners no longer need to be worried about the security of their data. The proposed model's assessment parameters include latency, throughput, privacy, and accuracy. The data privacy of the proposed model is protected via LDP and FL, and its latency and throughput communication transactions on permissioned blockchain are calculated and compared with those of the benchmark model.

However, it is still inadequate to learn the global model safely at the centralized aggregator, which is an essential part for the traditional FL architecture. Specifically, when using FL in radio access networks to enable edge intelligence, it is difficult for a central server, which belongs to a third party, to guarantee its credibility. Moreover, because the central server may cause a single point of failure, its reliability is also difficult to guarantee. Besides, a malicious participating node of FL may send ill parameters for model aggregation. In this article, we develop a blockchain assisted federated learning (BC-FL) framework, with aim to overcome the single point of failure caused by central server. Meanwhile, we propose to use blockchain to implement auditing of individual involved nodes to ensure the reliability of learning process. To avoid privacy leakage during the audit process to the greatest extent, we design a matching audit mechanism to realize efficient random matching audit process. A cryptocurrency free delegated byzantine fault tolerant (CF-DBFT) consensus mechanism is also designed to realize the low-latency distributed consensus of all nodes in the FL proces. We apply the proposed BC-FL framework to resolve the computing resource allocation problem at the edger servers in MEC network. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and performance superiority of the proposed BC-FL framework.

Moreover, to better understand the mobile devices' behaviors, we provide economic analysis for this market. Specifically, we propose two strategy models of mobile devices, namely the discrete strategy model (DSM) and the continuous strategy model (CSM). Also, we formulate the interactions among the non-cooperative mobile devices as a dynamic game, where they adjust their strategies iteratively to maximize the individual payoff based on others' previous strategies.

UAVs mainly communicate with mobile base stations, ground stations (GS), or networked peer UAVs, known as UAV swarms. UAVs communicate with GS, or UAV swarms, over wireless channels to support mission-critical operations. Communication latency, bandwidth, and precision are of prime importance in such operations. With the rise of data-driven applications, fifth-generation (5G) networks would face bottlenecks to communicate at near-real-time, at low latency and improved coverage. Thus, researchers have shifted towards network designs that incorporate beyond 5G (B5G) networks for UAV designs. However, UAVs are resource-constrained, with limited power and battery, and thus centralized cloud-centric models are not suitable. Moreover, as exchanged data is through open channels, privacy and security issues exist. Federated learning (FL) allows data to be trained on local nodes, preserving privacy and improving network communication. However, sharing of local updates is required through a trusted consensus mechanism. Thus, blockchain (BC)-based FL schemes for UAVs allow trusted exchange of FL updates among UAV swarms and GS. To date, limited research has been carried out on the integration of BC and FL in UAV management. The proposed survey addresses the gap and presents a solution taxonomy of BC-based FL in UAVs for B5G networks due to the open problem. This paper presents a reference architecture and compares its potential benefits over traditional BC-based UAV networks. Open issues and challenges are discussed, with possible future directions. Finally, a logistics case study of BC-based FL-oriented UAVs in 6G networks is presented.

First, a two-layered architecture is proposed that consists of two types of blockchains: local model update chain (LMUC) assisted by device-to-device (D2D) communication and global model update chain (GMUC) supporting task sharding. The D2D-assisted LMUC is designed to chronologically and efficiently record all of the local model training results, which can help to form long-term reputations of local devices. The GMUC is proposed to provide both security and efficiency by preventing mobile edge computing nodes from malfunctioning and dividing them into logically isolated FL task-specific chains. Then a reputation-learning-based incentive mechanism is introduced to make participating local devices more trustful with a reward implemented by a smart contract.

However, it is still faced with the dilemma of lacking enough data sources in the current practice of artificial intelligence. In this context, distributed machine learning aggregates edge devices' raw data into a parameter server for model training, but it easily leads to data privacy leakage and causes excessive storage overhead. In particular, federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning framework that stores data locally, which can effectively protect the data privacy of edge intelligent nodes. According to client settings, FL can be classified into two types: cross-device FL and cross-silo FL. In cross-device FL, a central entity acts as the central parameter server, which is also the owner of the global model. Meanwhile, the participating nodes as the clients to perform local training. In cross-silo FL, all participating nodes act as the clients to perform local training. In addition, they are also the owners of the global model and can make use of the trained global model. In this paper, we focus on cross-device FL, in which intelligence edge devices can provide model training services by sensing the raw data from IoT devices such as intelligence vehicles, smartphones etc. Most of the existing cross-device FL implements model aggregated by uploading the intermediate parameters of model training to the parameter server. There are two problems in this process. On the one hand, there is privacy leakage of intermediate parameters. The existing privacy protection schemes usually use differential privacy to add the noise on intermediate parameters, but excessive noise will reduce the quality of the global model. On the other hand, the training process of node self-interest and full autonomy may lead to malicious nodes uploading false parameters or low-quality models, thus affect the aggregation processes and model quality. In this paper, the centralized parameter server in federated learning is constructed as a decentralized parameter aggregation chain, and the intermediate parameters of the model training process recorded on the blockchain as evidence. Moreover, the cooperative nodes are encouraged to verify the model parameters and punish the participating nodes who upload false parameters or low-quality models so as to restrict their self-interest. In view of above challenges, we take the model quality as the metric to dynamically adjust privacy noise of intermediate parameters and propose a federated adaptive (FedAdp) model aggregation algorithm. The prototype development and experimental simulations show that the proposed FedAdp model aggregation algorithm can achieve higher accuracy of aggregation model when occur poisoning attack. By dynamically adjusting the Laplace random noise, it's realized the tradeoff between privacy protection and the accuracy error of the aggregation model. The experiment of blockchain performance confirmed that our scheme has good practicability. It is proved that the model can not only enhance the mutual trust between the participating nodes of federated learning, but also prevent the privacy disclosure of intermediate parameters, so as to realize the federated learning model with enhanced trust and privacy protection. © 2021, Science Press.

A direct solution is to collect as many devices as possible to establish a large BFL cluster. However, these devices may locate in geographically distant areas and be separated by great distance, which further results in high communication latency.

Traditionally, AI techniques often require centralized data collection and training in a single entity, e.g., an MEC server, which is now becoming a weak point due to data privacy concerns and high overhead of raw data communications. In this context, federated learning (FL) has been proposed to provide collaborative data training solutions, by coordinating multiple mobile devices to train a shared AI model without directly exposing their underlying data, which enjoys considerable privacy enhancement. To improve the security and scalability of FL implementation, blockchain as a ledger technology is attractive for realizing decentralized FL training without the need for any central server. Particularly, the integration of FL and blockchain leads to a new paradigm, called FLchain, which potentially transforms intelligent MEC networks into decentralized, secure, and privacy-enhancing systems. This article presents an overview of the fundamental concepts and explores the opportunities of FLchain in MEC networks. We identify several main issues in FLchain design, including communication cost, resource allocation, incentive mechanism, security and privacy protection. The key solutions and the lessons learned along with the outlooks are also discussed.

The second real-world problem is to share the data among the hospitals globally while keeping in view the privacy concerns of the organizations. Building a collaborative model and preserving privacy are the major concerns for training a global deep learning model. This paper proposes a framework that collects a small amount of data from different sources (various hospitals) and trains a global deep learning model using blockchain-based federated learning. Blockchain technology authenticates the data and federated learning trains the model globally while preserving the privacy of the organization. First, we propose a data normalization technique that deals with the heterogeneity of data as the data is gathered from different hospitals having different kinds of Computed Tomography (CT) scanners. Secondly, we use Capsule Network-based segmentation and classification to detect COVID-19 patients. Thirdly, we design a method that can collaboratively train a global model using blockchain technology with federated learning while preserving privacy.

The proposed hierarchical blockchain framework is feasible for the large scale vehicular networks. The hierarchical federated learning algorithm is designed to meet the distributed pattern and privacy requirement of IoVs. Knowledge sharing is then modeled as a trading market process to stimulate sharing behaviours, and the trading process is formulated as a multi-leader and multi-player game.

Recent industrial research works introduce the sovereign-identity system, where Blockchain becomes a decentralized component to establish a self-certified identity and to avoid a centralized trust third party. Hence, the classification of distributed transactions with respect to identity validation across several users becomes more challenging, especially because of the massive and sensitive identities that are issued through many users and IoT devices and that are used to validate transactions. In this context, it is important to identify and classify the malicious and non-malicious types of transactions. Our proposed method achieves the target of identity classifications from variety of transaction data.

The development of edge computing makes it possible to apply federated learning to beyond 5G.

Under these settings, federated learning protects users from exposing their private data, while cooperatively training a shared machine learning algorithm model (i.e., the global model) for a variety of realworld applications. The only data exchanged is the gradient of the model or the updated model (i.e., the local model update). However, the security of federated learning is increasingly being questioned, due to the malicious clients or central servers' constant attack on the global model or user privacy data. To address these security issues, we propose a decentralized federated learning framework based on blockchain, that is, a Block-chain-based Federated Learning framework with Committee consensus (BFLC). Without a centralized server, the framework uses blockchain for the global model storage and the local model update exchange. To enable the proposed BFLC, we also devise an innovative committee consensus mechanism, which can effectively reduce the amount of consensus computing and reduce malicious attacks. We then discuss the scalability of BFLC, including theoretical security, storage optimization, and incentives.

Then, manufacturers can predict customers' requirements and consumption behaviors in the future. The working flow of the system includes two stages: in the first stage, customers train the initial model provided by the manufacturer using both the mobile phone and the mobile-edge computing (MEC) server. Customers collect data from various home appliances using phones, and then they download and train the initial model with their local data. After deriving local models, customers sign on their models and send them to the blockchain. In case customers or manufacturers are malicious, we use the blockchain to replace the centralized aggregator in the traditional FL system. Since records on the blockchain are untampered, malicious customers or manufacturers' activities are traceable. In the second stage, manufacturers select customers or organizations as miners for calculating the averaged model using received models from customers. By the end of the crowdsourcing task, one of the miners, who is selected as the temporary leader, uploads the model to the blockchain. To protect customers' privacy and improve the test accuracy, we enforce differential privacy (DP) on the extracted features and propose a new normalization technique.

However, the decentralized model aggregation is vulnerable to pooling and collusion attacks from the third-party blockchain network. Driven by this issue, we propose a novel BFL framework that features the integration of training and mining at the client side. In our framework, the client first transmits its trained model to other clients, performs global aggregation upon receiving others' models, and competes to mine a block for aggregated model verification without the intervention of any third-party blockchain network. Considering the model transmission over time-varying wireless channels, we propose a dynamic training client scheduling to meet stringent latency requirement in FL, where clients with qualified channel conditions are scheduled to train their models in each communication round. Furthermore, we formulate a joint optimization problem of the training client scheduling and dynamic resource allocation (i.e., the transmit and computation power at the client side) under the constraint of long-term time-average (LTA) energy consumption. The objective of this optimization problem is to maximize the LTA training data size and thereby optimize the learning performance of FL.

In this paper, a blockchain-based asynchronous federated learning framework with a dynamic scaling factor is proposed. By adopting the blockchain, the trust problem among devices can be addressed. Meanwhile, the novel dynamic scaling factor is proposed to help improve the FL efficiency and accuracy.

Seeking to contribute to the literature, we propose a Blockchain Empowered Secure and Incentive Federated Learning (BESIFL) paradigm in this paper.

This integration with end users produces large-scale and heterogeneous data sources that demand machine learning (ML)-based data analytics for decision-making and to provide security against ML and data privacy attacks. The development of privacy-aware ML models within a federated learning (FL) ecosystem can empower an entire network to learn from data in a decentralized manner. In this article, we propose a differentially privacy blockchain-based explainable FL (DP-BFL) framework by harnessing the ever-evolving power of SM 3.0 networks. This framework permits any Internet empowered device to partake and contribute data to a global privacy preserved model. In this framework, participants will upload the differentially private local updates to the miners of blockchain, where the local updates will be evaluated and rewarded. The experimental results obtained from real-world datasets, namely, SM 3.0 and MNIST, demonstrated that the proposed framework could achieve high utility, enhanced privacy, and elevated efficiency. More Specifically, the experimental analysis of our proposed framework reveals the following two key properties. First, our proposed DP-BFL yields noticeable performance improvements in the applied learning models with high privacy and comparable utility levels, in terms of accuracy and f-measure metrics, to a standard FL and centralized learning approaches under the restriction of privacy preservation. Second, given a certain number of the malicious entities, DP-BFL allowed an enhanced recognition of users' preferences in the SM 3.0 dataset and precise prediction of images' class in the MNIST dataset while mitigating the impact of the malicious entities' poisoned updates. Moreover, as the proposed DP-BFL attains DP on the local model's update, it is considered the same as the standard FL-based setting, along with some kinds of privacy preservation on the uploaded model's updates.

Moreover, FL is feasible for scenarios (e.g., autonomous cars) where an enormous amount of data is generated every day. Transferring only local model updates in the case of FL is highly communication-efficient compared to transferring all data in the case of centralized machine learning (ML). Although FL offers many advantages, it also has some challenges. A malicious aggregation server can infer device information via local model updates. Another downside of FL is the centralized aggregation server that can malfunction due to an attack or physical damage. To address these issues, we propose a novel Structured Transparency empowered cross-silo Federated Learning on the Blockchain (ST-BFL) framework. In ST-BFL, homomorphic encryption, FL-aggregators, FL-verifiers, and smart contract are employed, which satisfy various structured transparency components, such as input privacy, output privacy, output verification, and flow governance. We present the framework architecture, algorithms, and sequence diagram of our ST-BFL framework to show how different entities interact in ST-BFL for the FL process. We also present a simplified class diagram of ST-BFL's smart contract for an FL task. Finally, we perform a simulation to analyze our framework from the perspective of aggregation time, accuracy, and storage size.

Moreover, blockchain was introduced to solve many network issues in regard to data privacy and network single point of failure. In this article, we introduce a solution that integrates both federated learning and blockchain to ensure both data privacy and network security. We present a framework to decentralize the mutual machine learning models on end-devices. A blockchain-based consensus solution as a second line of privacy is used to ensure trustworthy shared training on the fog. The proposed model enables on-end device machine learning without any centralized training of the data nor coordination by utilizing a consensus method in the blockchain.

It is a promising mechanism since it empowers collaboration in fields such as medicine and banking where data sharing is not favorable due to legal, technical, ethical, or safety issues without significantly sacrificing accuracy. In centralized federated learning, there is a single central server, and hence it has a single point of failure. Unlike centralized federated learning, decentralized federated learning does not depend on a single central server for the updates. In this paper, we propose a decentralized federated learning approach named Chain FL that makes use of the blockchain to delegate the responsibility of storing the model to the nodes on the network instead of a centralized server.

Hence, a human oracle is required to gradually annotate the data patterns at run-time to improve the models' learning behavior, through an active learning strategy in form of User Feedback Process (UFP). Consequently, it is worth to note that during UFP there may exist malicious content that may subject the learning model to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, more so, manipulative attacks. We argue in this position paper, that there are instances during incremental learning, where the local data model may present wrong output, if retraining is done using data that has already been subjected to adversarial attack. We propose a Distributed Interactive Secure Federated Learning (DISFL) framework that utilizes UFP in the edge and fog node, that subsequently increases the amount of labelled personal local data for the ML model during incremental training. Furthermore, the DISFL framework addresses data privacy by leveraging federated learning, where only the model's knowledge is moved to a global unit, herein referred to as Collective Intelligence Node (CIN). During incremental learning, this would then allow the creation of an immutable chain of data that has to be trained, which in its entirety is tamper-free while increasing trust between parties.

BFL enables oVML without any centralized training data or coordination by utilizing the consensus mechanism of the blockchain. Relying on a renewal reward approach, we develop a mathematical framework that features the controllable network and BFL parameters (e.g., the retransmission limit, block size, block arrival rate, and the frame sizes) so as to capture their impact on the system-level performance. More importantly, our rigorous analysis of oVML system dynamics quantifies the end-to-end delay with BFL, which provides important insights into deriving optimal block arrival rate by considering communication and consensus delays. We present a variety of numerical and simulation results highlighting various non-trivial findings and insights for adaptive BFL design. In particular, based on analytical results, we minimize the system delay by exploiting the channel dynamics and demonstrate that the proposed idea of tuning the block arrival rate is provably online and capable of driving the system dynamics to the desired operating point. It also identifies the improved dependency on other blockchain parameters for a given set of channel conditions, retransmission limits, and frame sizes.

To solve this problem, many researchers have proposed blockchain-enabled FL to reward workers (or users) with cryptocurrencies to encourage workers to follow the protocols. However, there is a lack of theoretical discussions concerning how such rewards impact workers&#x2019; behavior and how much should be given to workers. In this paper, we propose a mechanism-design-oriented FL protocol on a public blockchain network. Mechanism design (MD) is often used to make a rule intended to achieve a specific goal. With MD in mind, we introduce the concept of competition into blockchain-based FL so that only workers who have contributed well can obtain rewards, which naturally prevents workers from deviating from the protocol. We then mathematically answer the following questions with contest theory, a novel field of study in economics: i) What behavior will workers take?; ii) how much effort should workers exert to maximize their profits?; iii) how many workers should be rewarded?; and iv) what is the best proportion for reward distribution?.

However, large-scale FEL still faces following crucial challenges: (i) there lacks a secure and communication-efficient model training scheme for FEL; (2) there is no scalable and flexible FEL framework for updating local models and global model sharing (trading) management. To bridge the gaps, we first propose a blockchain-empowered secure FEL system with a hierarchical blockchain framework consisting of a main chain and subchains. This framework can achieve scalable and flexible decentralized FEL by individually manage local model updates or model sharing records for performance isolation. A Proof-of-Verifying consensus scheme is then designed to remove low-quality model updates and manage qualified model updates in a decentralized and secure manner, thereby achieving secure FEL. To improve communication efficiency of the blockchain-empowered FEL, a gradient compression scheme is designed to generate sparse but important gradients to reduce communication overhead without compromising accuracy, and also further strengthen privacy preservation of training data. The security analysis and numerical results indicate that the proposed schemes can achieve secure, scalable, and communication-efficient decentralized FEL. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",,,Communications in Computer and Information Science,10.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097195294&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-15-9213-3_12&partnerID=40&md5=2a9f6780578374de96ef9717ce78b54f,Blockchain; Communication efficiency; Federated edge learning; Gradient compression; Security,Data privacy; Efficiency; Learning systems; Block-chain; Communication efficiency; Decentralised; Federated edge learning; Gradient compression; Learning techniques; Local model; Model sharing; Model updates; Security; Blockchain,Conference Paper,Final,"All Open Access, Green",2-s2.0-85097195294

This is because only the training results, i.e., the updated model parameters and model weights are needed to report to the FL server for aggregation in each round of FL-training. However, during the model transmission of the original FL protocol, there is no security guarantee towards the training results. Thus, every step during model uploading phase can be attacked by malicious attackers. To address such threat, we propose a new federated learning architecture by taking the advantages of blockchain into account. The proposed architecture includes two-phase design. The first phase is a numerical evaluation, which can prevent the malicious devices from being selected. For the second phase, we devise a participant-selection algorithm that enables the FL server to select the appropriate group of devices for each round of FL-training.

Federated Learning and the blockchain are two technologies that tackle these challenges and have been shown to be beneficial in medical contexts where data are often distributed and coming from different sources. In this paper we propose to integrate these two technologies for the first time in a medical setting. In particular, we propose a implementation of a coordinating server for a federated learning algorithm to share information for improved predictions while ensuring data transparency and usage consent. We illustrate the approach with a prediction decision support tool applied to a diabetes data-set.

In particular, Federated Learning (FL) is a key enabler to realize decentralized AI model update without user's privacy disclosure. However, since the behaviour of workers, who are assigned a training task, cannot be monitored, the state-of-the-art methods require a special hardware and/or cryptography to force the workers behave honestly, which hinders the realization. Furthermore, although blockchain-enabled FL has been proposed to give workers reward, any rigorous reward policy design has not been discussed. In this paper, to tackle these issues, we present a novel method using mechanism design, which is an economic approach to realize desired objectives under the situation that participants act rationally. The key idea is to introduce repeated competition for FL so that any rational worker follows the protocol and maximize their profits. With mechanism design, we propose a generic full-fledged protocol design for FL on a public blockchain.

The FL progresses learning locally on each device and gradually improves the learning model through interaction with the central server. However, it can cause network overload because of limited communication bandwidth and the participation of a huge number of users. One of the ways to minimize the network load is for the model to converge rapidly and stably with target learning accuracy. In this paper, we propose blockchain based federated learning scenario. Blockchain can efficiently induce users to participate in learning and can separate each participating user as a 'node'. In addition, it can be pursued the integrity, stability, and so on. We consider two types of weights to choose the subset of clients for updating the global model. First, we consider the weight based on local learning accuracy of each client. Second, we consider the weight based on participation frequency of each client. We choose two key performance indicators, learning speed and standard deviation, to compare the performance of our proposed scheme with existing schemes. The simulation results show that our proposed scheme achieves higher stability along with fast convergence time for targeted accuracy compared to others. © 2019 IEICE.",,,"2019 20th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium: Management in a Cyber-Physical World, APNOMS 2019",41.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075281582&doi=10.23919%2fAPNOMS.2019.8893114&partnerID=40&md5=4bce6c9df85bd75965e4726bfccacdf0,Blockchain; Federated Learning; Node Selection; Weighting scheme,Benchmarking; Blockchain; Decentralized learning; Federated Learning; Key performance indicators; Learning performance; Limited communication; Node selection; Standard deviation; Weighting scheme; Learning systems,Conference Paper,Final,,2-s2.0-85075281582

FL is extremely useful due to its ensuring privacy, lower latency, less power consumption and smarter models, but it could fail if multiple trainers abort training or send malformed messages to its partners. Such misbehavior are not auditable and parameter server may compute incorrectly due to single point failure. Furthermore, FL has no incentive to attract sufficient distributed training data and computation power. In this paper, we propose FLChain to build a decentralized, public auditable and healthy FL ecosystem with trust and incentive. FLChain replace traditional FL parameter server whose computation result must be consensual on-chain. Our work is not trivial when it is vital and hard to provide enough incentive and deterrence to distributed trainers. We achieve model commercialization by providing a healthy marketplace for collaborative-training models. Honest trainer can gain fairly partitioned profit from well-trained model according to its contribution and the malicious can be timely detected and heavily punished. To reduce the time cost of misbehavior detecting and model query, we design DDCBF for accelerating the query of blockchain-documented information.
