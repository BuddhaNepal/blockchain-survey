Another challenge is that patients' data is vulnerable to disclosures. To address these problems, we propose a meta continual learning method, called MetaCL. MetaCL consists of a shared feature extractor, a knowledge base, a micro classifier module and a blockchain module. The shared feature extractor adopts a horizontal federated learning mechanism to prevent data leakage. The knowledge base is built and updated based on a Splite-based method to overcome catastrophic forgetting. The micro classifier module uses a mean-based model transfer method to adapt to the emergence of new classes. It integrates a Kullback-Leibler divergence regularization to the loss function to deal with fuzzy boundaries of classes. The blockchain module is designed based on the Alliance chain to protect the privacy of the classification results. Experiment results show that refinement classification performance of MetaCL is 98.35%, which outperforms the compared state-of-the-art works. The backward transfer under four increment scenarios is all within -2.6%. At last, a blockchain-based engineering application is presented to show that MetaCL can prevent privacy protection in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Blockchain; Continual learning; Federated learning; Physiological signal classification; Privacy protection","Data mining; Knowledge based systems; Learning systems; Physiology; Block-chain; Continual learning; Dynamic distribution; Feature extractor; Federated learning; Physiological signal classification; Physiological signal processing; Physiological signals; Privacy protection; Signal classification; Blockchain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85148700252

However, with the dramatic increase in the deployment of shared communications between organizations, data has been a major priority to detect threats in the CTI sharing platform. In the modern environment, a valuable asset is the user's threat data. Privacy policies are necessary to ensure the security of user data in the threat intelligence sharing community. Federated learning acts as a special machine learning technique for privacy preservation and offers to contextualize data in a CTI sharing platform. Therefore, this article proposes a new approach to threat intelligence sharing called BFLS (Blockchain and Federated Learning for sharing threat detection models as Cyber Threat Intelligence), where blockchain-based CTI sharing platforms are used for security and privacy. Federated learning technology is adopted for scalable machine learning applications, such as threat detection. Furthermore, users can obtain a well-trained threat detection model without sending personal data to the central server. Experimental results on the ISCX-IDS-2012 and CIC-DDoS-2019 datasets showed that BFLS can securely share CTI and has high accuracy in threat detection. The accuracies of BFLS are 98.92% and 98.56% on the two datasets, respectively. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Blockchain; Cyber Threat Intelligence; Federated learning; Threat detection","Cybersecurity; Data privacy; Machine learning; Network security; Block-chain; Cybe threat intelligence; Cyber threats; Cyber-attacks; Detection models; Federated learning; Intelligence sharing; Privacy policies; Sharing platforms; Threat detection; Blockchain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85147846208

However, current approaches are moving away from centralized orchestration toward a decentralized one in order to fully adapt FL for a cross-silo configuration with multiple organizations acting as clients. State-of-the-art decentralized FL mechanisms make at least one of the following assumptions: 1) clients are trusted organizations and cannot inject low-quality model updates for aggregation and 2) client local models can be shared with other clients or a third party for verification of low-quality updates. This article proposes a Blockchain-based decentralized framework for scenarios where participatory organizations are believed to be fully capable of injecting low-quality model updates as they are not willing to expose their local models to any other entity for verification purpose. The proposed decentralized FL framework adopts a novel hierarchical network of aggregators with the ability to punish/reward organizations in proportion to their local model quality updates. The framework is flexible and unlike state-of-the-art solutions, prevents a single entity from possessing the aggregated model in any FL round of training. The proposed framework is tested with respect to off-chain and on-chain performance in two Industry 4.0 use cases: 1) predictive maintenance and 2) product visual inspection. A comparative evaluation against the state-of-the-art reveals the proposed framework's utility in terms of minimizing model convergence time and latency while maximizing accuracy and throughput. © 2014 IEEE.","Blockchain; federated learning (FL); industry 4.0","Client server computer systems; Industry 4.0; Block-chain; Computational modelling; Decentralised; Federated learning; Fourth industrial revolution; Industrial revolutions; Low qualities; Predictive models; State of the art; Blockchain",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85141626824

Design the authentication mechanism in blockchain to filter out users who are malicious attackers to protect the security of other users' information initially. To accelerate the speed of cloud model training and resist multiple attacks in federated learning, propose a periodic aggregation method combining differential privacy mechanisms.

When it comes to determining the identity of COVID-19, one of the most significant obstacles that researchers must overcome is the rapid propagation of the virus, in addition to the dearth of trustworthy testing models. This problem continues to be the most difficult one for clinicians to deal with. The use of AI in image processing has made the formerly insurmountable challenge of finding COVID-19 situations more manageable. In the real world, there is a problem that has to be handled about the difficulties of sharing data between hospitals while still honoring the privacy concerns of the organizations. When training a global deep learning (DL) model, it is crucial to handle fundamental concerns such as user privacy and collaborative model development. For this study, a novel framework is designed that compiles information from five different databases (several hospitals) and edifies a global model using blockchain-based federated learning (FL). The data is validated through the use of blockchain technology (BCT), and FL trains the model on a global scale while maintaining the secrecy of the organizations. The proposed framework is divided into three parts. First, we provide a method of data normalization that can handle the diversity of data collected from five different sources using several computed tomography (CT) scanners. Second, to categorize COVID-19 patients, we ensemble the capsule network (CapsNet) with incremental extreme learning machines (IELMs). Thirdly, we provide a strategy for interactively training a global model using BCT and FL while maintaining anonymity. Extensive tests employing chest CT scans and a comparison of the classification performance of the proposed model to that of five DL algorithms for predicting COVID-19, while protecting the privacy of the data for a variety of users, were undertaken. Our findings indicate improved effectiveness in identifying COVID-19 patients and achieved an accuracy of 98.99%.

However, traditional federated learning still suffers from single-point server failure, which is a frequent issue from the centralized server for global model aggregation. Additionally, it also lacks an incentive mechanism, which leads to the insufficient contribution of local devices to global model training. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based decentralized federated learning method, named BD-FL, to solve these problems. BD-FL combines blockchain and edge computing techniques to build a decentralized federated learning system. An incentive mechanism is introduced to motivate local devices to actively participate in federated learning model training. In order to minimize the cost of model training, BD-FL designs a preference-based stable matching algorithm to bind local devices with appropriate edge servers, which can reduce communication overhead. In addition, we propose a reputation-based practical Byzantine fault tolerance (R-PBFT) algorithm to optimize the consensus process of global model training in the blockchain. Experiment results show that BD-FL effectively reduces the model training time by up to 34.9% compared with several baseline federated learning methods.

Rather than the data, only gradients are shared among all collaborative nodes with the help of a central server. To ensure the data privacy, the gradients are prone to the deformation, or the representation is perturbed before sharing, ultimately reducing the performance of the model. Recent studies show that the original data can still be recovered using latent space (i.e., gradient leakage problem) by Generative Adversarial Network and different optimization algorithms such as Bayesian and Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy. To address the issues of data privacy and gradient leakage, in this paper, we train deep neural networks by exploiting the blockchain-based Swarm Learning (SL) framework. In the SL scheme, instead of sharing perturbed or noisy gradients to the central server, we share the original gradients among authenticated (i.e., blockchain-based smart contract) training nodes.

Nevertheless, it is still challenging for guaranteeing any FL models to be effective due to the sluggish willingness of IoT devices and the model poisoning attacks in the FL. To address these issues, in this paper, we introduce blockchain technology and propose a blockchain-based FL framework for supporting a trustworthy and reliable FL paradigm in IoT.

The technique used blockchain-based cascade encryption and trust evaluation in a hierarchical design to generate blockchain trust values before beacon nodes broadcast data to the base station. Simulation results reveal that cascading encryption and feature assessment measure the trust value of nodes by rewarding each other for service provisioning and trust by removing malicious nodes that reduce localization accuracy and quality of service in the network. Federated machine learning improves data security and transmission by merging raw device data and placing malicious threats in the blockchain. Malicious nodes are classified through federated learning. Federated learning combines hybrid random forest, gradient boost, ensemble learning, K-means clustering, and support vector machine approaches to classify harmful nodes via a feature assessment process. Comparing the proposed system to current ones shows an average detection and classification accuracy of 100% for binary and 99.95% for multiclass.

Thus, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) must evolve to cope with these increasingly sophisticated and challenging security threats. Traditional IDSs are prone to zero-day attacks since they are usually signature-based detection systems. The recent advent of machine learning and deep learning (ML/DL) techniques can help strengthen these IDSs. However, the lack of up-to-date labeled training datasets makes these ML/DL based IDSs inefficient. The privacy nature of these datasets and widespread emergence of adversarial attacks make it difficult for major organizations to share their sensitive data. Federated Learning (FL) is gaining momentum from both academia and industry as a new sub-field of ML that aims to train a global statistical model across multiple distributed users, referred to as collaborators, without sharing their private data. Due to its privacy-preserving nature, FL has the potential to enable privacy-aware learning between a large number of collaborators. This paper presents a novel framework, called MiTFed, that allows multiple software defined networks (SDN) domains (<inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$i.e.,$</tex-math></inline-formula> collaborators) to collaboratively build a global intrusion detection model without sharing their sensitive datasets. In particular, MiTFed consists of: (1) a novel distributed architecture that allows multiple SDN based domains to securely collaborate in order to cope with sophisticated security threats while preserving the privacy of each SDN domain; (2) a novel Secure Multiparty Computation (SMPC) scheme to securely aggregate local model updates; and (3) a blockchain based scheme that uses Ethereum smart contracts to maintain the collaboration in a fully decentralized, trustworthy, flexible, and efficient manner. To the best of our knowledge, MiTFed is the first framework that leverages FL, blockchain and SDN technologies to mitigate the new emerging security threats in large scale. To evaluate MiTFed, we conduct several experiments using real-world network attacks; the experimental results using the well-known public network security dataset NSL-KDD show that MiTFed achieves efficiency and high accuracy in detecting the new emerging security threats in both binary and multi-class classification while preserving the privacy of collaborators, making it a promising framework to cope with the new emerging security threats in SDN.

Digital twin technology (DT) introduces a coupled virtual-physical asset system that evolves over time in their digital and physical state-spaces associated with the real-time exchange of observed data and control inputs for high-fidelity operational services in UAM, such as traffic management, or vehicle maintenance. On the other hand, edge computing has been envisioned as a dominant computing paradigm in future UAM infrastructures to enable infinitesimal-latency processing of massive and heterogeneous data acquired from ubiquitous devices and vehicles. Furthermore, federated learning (FL) has recently been proposed to resolve the performance and security problems of traditional AI techniques featured by centralized data collection and training to offer a decentralized and cooperative data training pattern among a huge number of devices/vehicles (aka., agents) in multi agent DT systems for UAM. Lastly, the blockchain has emerged as a ledger technology in which data and processes are divided into tiny data blocks and concatenated into a series to reinforce the security and scalability of decentralized computing patterns. Realizing the advances and integration of the emerging technologies mentioned above is of paramount importance for the development of DT systems in UAM. Previous studies have not completely considered the integration and harmony of these existing technologies for the development of UAM DT systems. There has also been a significant lack in comprehension and integration of emerging technologies for the development of UAM-DT systems. In that context, this study proposes a comprehensive integrated UAM-DT platform and solution of FL with the blockchain in edge computing for the development of UAM-DT systems, called BlockFE-DT. First, we introduce the adoption of a probabilistic graphical model as a formal mathematical foundation of coupled digital-physical twin systems for UAM, particularly for unmanned aircrafts. Afterwards, we review the fundamental concepts of FL, blockchain, and edge computing technologies to explore and propose an integration framework of FL with the blockchain in edge computing in the context of UAM-DT systems. Key issues in the integration are assimilated including explainable AI, dependability, and security.

With the new variants of SARS-CoV-2, a lot of people are even scared of going to the health centers to get the COVID-19 evaluation in fear of contamination and contagious, which caused the surge in the symptoms at later stages. Data collected across various sources can play an important role in predicting and identifying of COVID-19 virus based on the models and the classifications of this data using the most sophisticated machine learning models. The concern here is accessing or transferring an individual’s data from their personal health devices which defers users’ privacy. In the recent past, there are a lot of research that has been done these days on how blockchain can help to securely track and transfer the data across trusted sources. Adding to this, federated learning also is helping on-device data usage without any critical data to be transferred to various external sources. The proposed study directs the stability of frequent health status with the help of wearable devices that capture health metrics like heart rate, blood oxygen levels, breathing rate, muscle activities, stress, emotions, movement patterns, sleep activity, precipitation, and mind/cognitive functions with the introduction of the data streams and models that can seamlessly transfer the data, with the assurance of data integrity, privacy, and control which is the scope of this paper. The usage of both the emerging technologies provides a value addition in terms of health data exchange with effective data distribution with decentralized privacy and computation. We have also introduced a consent-based personal health device registration mechanism on a blockchain consensus network with digital identity to allow and take back controls over who can access their data. We believe that this solution and the implementation would help everyone to predict the possible COVID-19 infections keeping data privacy at the most priority. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Distributed ledger; On-device learning; Secure aggregation; Secure by device consent; Training loop",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140461282

How to manage these massive data safely and reliably has become an important challenge for the medical network community. This paper proposes a data management framework of medical network community based on Consortium Blockchain (CB) and Federated learning (FL), which realizes the data security sharing between medical institutions and research institutions. Under this framework, the data security sharing mechanism of medical network community based on smart contract and the data privacy protection mechanism based on FL and alliance chain are designed to ensure the security of data and the privacy of important data in medical network community, respectively. An intelligent contract system based on Keyed-Homomorphic Public Key (KH-PKE) Encryption scheme is designed, so that medical data can be saved in the CB in the form of ciphertext, and the automatic sharing of data is realized. Zero knowledge mechanism is used to ensure the correctness of shared data. Moreover, the zero-knowledge mechanism introduces the dynamic group signature mechanism of chosen ciphertext attack (CCA) anonymity, which makes the scheme more efficient in computing and communication cost.

As a nascent branch for trustworthy AI, federated learning (FL) has been regarded as a promising privacy preserving framework for training a global AI model over collaborative devices. However, security challenges still exist in the FL framework, e.g., Byzantine attacks from malicious devices, and model tampering attacks from malicious server, which will degrade or destroy the accuracy of trained global AI model. In this article, we shall propose a decentralized blockchain-based FL (B-FL) architecture by using a secure global aggregation algorithm to resist malicious devices, and deploying a practical Byzantine fault tolerance consensus protocol with high effectiveness and low energy consumption among multiple edge servers to prevent model tampering from the malicious server. However, to implement B-FL system at the network edge, multiple rounds of cross-validation in blockchain consensus protocol will induce long training latency. We thus formulate a network optimization problem that jointly considers bandwidth and power allocation for the minimization of long-term average training latency consisting of progressive learning rounds. We further propose to transform the network optimization problem as a Markov decision process and leverage the deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm to provide high system performance with low computational complexity.

However, with the traditional AI approach, users sharing their raw data causes many concerns in terms of privacy leakage. There have been reports that there are privacy violations on private data of users. In the medical field, the creation of devices to help automatically diagnose the user's disease is gradually becoming a trend in the future. These devices help users monitor their own health, thereby reducing pressure on medical facilities that are often overloaded. However, the healthcare data of individuals will often be very sensitive and rarely shared by users. In addition, the profits generated from machine learning (ML) models mostly belong to the owners of that model. It also becomes an obstacle in encouraging users to share their data. In this article, we propose PriFL-Chain, a privacy-preservation framework to take advantage of data resources of data owners for training ML-based models, while ensuring the privacy of data owners. Specifically, we apply Differential privacy (DP) to federated learning (FL) to train ML models. Users just share the ML model trained on their data instead of sharing the raw data. Furthermore, the contribution activities of users in the system are recorded to the Blockchain to ensure transparency. We also leverage Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to reduce the pressure on the central server and reduce data communication costs, making the system more flexible. Experimental results have demonstrated that the combined strategy of FL, Blockchain, IPFS, and MEC can help reduce the cost of training ML models, effectively protect privacy, and utilize data sources of diversity from the community. © 2022 ACM.","Blockchain; Differential Privacy; Federated learning; Mobile edge computing; Smart healthcare","Artificial intelligence; Cost reduction; Health care; Internet of things; Learning systems; Mobile edge computing; Privacy-preserving techniques; Sensitive data; Block-chain; Differential privacies; Federated learning; Filesystem; Learning models; Machine learning models; Privacy leakages; Privacy preserving; Smart healthcare; Training machines; Blockchain",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85143836967

The privacy-sensitive energy data are stored locally at edge prosumer nodes without revealing it to third parties, with only the learned local model weights being shared using a blockchain network. The global federated model is not centralized but distributed and replicated over the blockchain overlay, ensuring the model immutability and provenance of parameter updates. We had proposed smart contracts to deal with the integration of local machine-learning prediction models with the blockchain, defining functions for the model parameters’ scaling and reduction of blockchain overhead.

They depend on the generation and sharing of data between vehicles to improve safety and efficiency of the transportation system. Due to the open feature of the vehicular ad hoc network (VANET), it is possible for dishonest and misbehaving vehicles to disrupt traffic by transmitting false information. In recent years, misbehavior detection systems have been developed to detect the malicious behaviour, and machine learning methods have been employed to make the detection more accurately. However, existing misbehavior detection systems typically require a single entity (e.g., a central server) for centralized data collection and training. Model updates are restricted due to data privacy and high overhead of data communication, which reduces the defensive capability of misbehavior detection systems. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based federated learning scheme to detect misbehavior, which is trained collaboratively by coordinating multiple distributed edge devices while ensuring data security and privacy. In addition, to further protect the privacy of the model on the blockchain, differential privacy with the Gaussian mechanism is leveraged to provide strict privacy protection.

Opposite to centralized intelligence, Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) relieves overwhelmed communication overhead and enjoys the advantages of high bandwidth as well as abundant computing resources while retaining privacy-preserving benefits of Federated Learning (FL). It is difficult to balance system overhead and model performance in the HFL framework, while it could be solved by introducing an incentive mechanism. Although the incentive mechanism can alleviate the above anxiety by compensating relevant participants, some limitations (multi-dimensional properties, incomplete information and unreliable participants) will significantly degrade the performance and efficiency of the designed mechanism. To address the challenges caused by the above limitations, we propose InFEDge, a blockchain-based incentive mechanism in the HFL. The InFEDge considers 1) multi-dimensional individual properties to model system participants and proves the uniqueness of Nash equilibrium with the closed-form solution.

Nevertheless, BFL tremendously escalates the communication traffic volume because all local model updates (i.e., changes of model parameters) obtained by BFL clients will be transmitted to all miners for verification and to all clients for aggregation. In contrast, the parameter server and clients in VFL only retain aggregated model updates. Consequently, the huge communication traffic in BFL will inevitably impair the training efficiency and hinder the deployment of BFL in reality. To improve the practicality of BFL, we are among the first to propose a fast blockchain-based communication-efficient federated learning framework by compressing communications in BFL, called BCFL. Meanwhile, we derive the convergence rate of BCFL with non-convex loss. To maximize the final model accuracy, we further formulate the problem to minimize the training loss of the convergence rate subject to a limited training time with respect to the compression rate and the block generation rate, which is a bi-convex optimization problem and can be efficiently solved. To the end, to demonstrate the efficiency of BCFL, we carry out extensive experiments with standard CIFAR-10 and FEMNIST datasets. Our experimental results not only verify the correctness of our analysis, but also manifest that BCFL can remarkably reduce the communication traffic by 95-98% or shorten the training time by 90-95% compared with BFL. © 1983-2012 IEEE.","blockchain; compression; convergence; Federated learning","Convex optimization; Efficiency; Learning systems; Block-chain; Compression; Computational modelling; Convergence; Federated learning; Learning frameworks; Load modeling; Blockchain",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140713410

In this system model, distributed mobile devices (MDs) communicate with a set of edge servers (ESs) to handle both machine learning (ML) model training and block mining simultaneously. To assist the ML model training for resource-constrained MDs, we develop an offloading strategy that enables MDs to transmit their data to one of the associated ESs. We then propose a new decentralized ML model aggregation solution at the edge layer based on a consensus mechanism to build a global ML model via peer-to-peer (P2P)-based blockchain communications. Blockchain builds trust among MDs and ESs to facilitate reliable ML model sharing and cooperative consensus formation, and enables rapid elimination of manipulated models caused by poisoning attacks. We formulate latency-aware BFL as an optimization aiming to minimize the system latency via joint consideration of the data offloading decisions, MDs' transmit power, channel bandwidth allocation for MDs' data offloading, MDs' computational allocation, and hash power allocation. Given the mixed action space of discrete offloading and continuous allocation variables, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning scheme with a parameterized advantage actor critic algorithm. We theoretically characterize the convergence properties of BFL in terms of the aggregation delay, mini-batch size, and number of P2P communication rounds. Our numerical evaluation demonstrates the superiority of our proposed scheme over baselines in terms of model training efficiency, convergence rate, system latency, and robustness against model poisoning attacks. © 1983-2012 IEEE.","actor-critic learning; blockchain; edge computing; Federated learning; network optimization","computation offloading; Data mining; Deep learning; Reinforcement learning; Actor-critic learning; Block-chain; Computational modelling; Edge computing; Edge server; Federated learning; Machine learning models; Network optimization; Optimisations; Blockchain",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139862203

With the rapid increase of MCS data throughput, traditional cloud platforms can no longer meet the huge data processing needs. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an MCS federated learning system based on Blockchain and edge computing. This paper uses federated learning as the framework of the MCS system.

Data has become an essential factor to improve these applications. Federated learning, a privacy-preserving machine learning method, is proposed to leverage data from different data owners. It is typically used in conjunction with cryptographic methods, in which data owners train the global model by sharing encrypted model updates. However, data encryption makes it difficult to identify the quality of these model updates. Malicious data owners may launch attacks such as data poisoning and free-riding. To defend against such attacks, it is necessary to find an approach to audit encrypted model updates. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based audit approach for encrypted gradients. It uses a behavior chain to record the encrypted gradients from data owners, and an audit chain to evaluate the gradients’ quality. Specifically, we propose a privacy-preserving homomorphic noise mechanism in which the noise of each gradient sums to zero after aggregation, ensuring the availability of aggregated gradient. In addition, we design a joint audit algorithm that can locate malicious data owners without decrypting individual gradients.

Specifically, the blockchain transforms the federated learning into a decentralized and trustworthy manner. Over the blockchain, federated learning tasks, undertaken by smart contracts, can be conducted transparently and fairly.

Focusing on this problem, we explore the impact of lazy clients on the learning performance of BLADE-FL, and characterize the relationship among the optimal K, the learning parameters, and the proportion of lazy clients.

However, one problem in vanilla BFL is that its capabilities do not follow adopters' needs in a dynamic fashion.

By training models locally at each client and aggregating learning models at a central server, FL has the capability to avoid sharing data directly, thereby reducing privacy leakage. However, the conventional FL framework relies heavily on a single central server, and it may fail if such a server behaves maliciously. To address this single point of failure, in this work, a blockchain-assisted decentralized FL framework is investigated, which can prevent malicious clients from poisoning the learning process, and thus provides a self-motivated and reliable learning environment for clients. In this framework, the model aggregation process is fully decentralized and the tasks of training for FL and mining for blockchain are integrated into each participant. Privacy and resource-allocation issues are further investigated in the proposed framework, and a critical and unique issue inherent in the proposed framework is disclosed.

In IoT Environments, Blockchain builds a trusted environment for IoT information sharing, where information is immutable and reliable. In particular, when edge devices are connected to a blockchain network, they need to be connected to reliable blockchain peers for synchronizing with valid data. Therefore, blockchain reliability prediction has gained attention owing to its ability to help users find highly reliable blockchain peers. Contextual information has been considered useful in many studies for generating highly personalized blockchain reliability predictions. However, these contextual factors are privacy-sensitive, and therefore disclosing them to third parties is risky. To address this challenge, we propose a privacy-preserving personalized blockchain reliability prediction model through federated learning neural collaborative filtering (FNCF) in IoT. Our model allows users to achieve user privacy protection without passing data to a third party and provides personalized predictions for users. We can also leverage the power of edge computing to enable a fast data processing capability and low latency required by IoT applications.

This paper aims to use blockchain as a trusted federated learning platform to realize the missing “running on untrusted domain” requirement. First, we investigate vanilla federate learning issues such as client’s low motivation, client dropouts, model poisoning, model stealing, and unauthorized access.

Users are more likely to choose the latter option, i.e., providing local but private data to the server and using ML apps, performing ML operations on the devices without benefiting from other users’ data, and preventing direct access to raw data and local training of ML models. FL protects data privacy and reduces data transfer overhead by storing raw data on devices and combining locally computed model updates. We have investigated the feasibility of data and model poisoning attacks under a blockchain-enabled FL system built alongside the Ethereum network and the traditional FL system (without blockchain). This work fills a knowledge gap by proposing a transparent incentive mechanism that can encourage good behavior among participating decentralized nodes and avoid common problems and provides knowledge for the FL security literature by investigating current FL systems. © 2022 by the authors.

There are two challenges in the crowdsourcing of FL, the workers who participant in training need to consume computing and communication resources, so that they are reluctant to participate in the training process if they can not get reasonable rewards. Moreover, there may be attackers who send arbitrary updates to get undeserving compensation or even destroy the model, thus, effective prevention of malicious workers is also critical. An incentive mechanism is urgently required in order to encourage high-quality workers to participate in FL and to punish the attackers. In this paper, we propose FGFL, a blockchain-based incentive governor for Federated Learning. In FGFL, we assess the participants with reputation and contribution indicators. Then the task publisher rewards workers fairly to attract efficient ones while the malicious ones are punished and eliminated. In addition, we propose a blockchain-based incentive management system to manage the incentive mechanism. We evaluate the effectiveness and fairness of FGFL through theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments. The evaluation results show that FGFL fairly rewards workers according to their corresponding behavior and quality.

As a new machine learning paradigm, federated learning (FL) avoids privacy leakage by allowing data models to be shared instead of raw data. Unfortunately, the traditional FL framework is strongly dependent on a centralized aggregation server, which will cause the system to crash if the server is compromised. Unauthorized participants may launch poisoning attacks, thereby reducing the usability of models. In addition, communication barriers hinder collaboration among a large number of cross-domain devices for learning.

Current FL approaches operate in an iterative manner by selecting a subset of participants each round, asking them to training using their latest local data over the most recent version of the global model, before collecting these local model updates and aggregating them to form the next iteration of the global model, and so forth until convergence is reached. Unfortunately, existing FL approaches typically select randomly the set of clients to use each round, which can negatively impact the quality of the model trained, as well the training round time due to the straggler problem. Moreover, clients, especially mobile devices with limited resources, should be incentivized to participate as federated learning is essentially a form of crowdsourcing for AI which requires monetization. We argue that the integration of blockchain and smart contract technologies to FL can solve the two aforementioned issues. In this paper, we present FL-MAB (FL- Multi-Auction using Blockchain), a client selection mechanism for FL operating in a smart contract which rewards clients for their participation using cryptocurrencies. FL-MAB employs a multidimensional auction mechanism for selecting users based on the compute and network resources offered by each client, as well as the quality of their local data. This auction is realized in a reliable and auditable manner through a smart contract. This allows FL-MAB to measure the relative contribution of each client by calculating a Shapley value, and allocating rewards accordingly. We have implemented FL-MAB using Solidity and tested on the Ethereum blockchain with various popular datasets. Our results show that FL-MAB outperforms existing baseline schemes by improving accuracy and reducing the no. of FL rounds. © 2022 ACM.","auction; blockchain; client selection; federated learning; monetization; smart contracts","Privacy-preserving techniques; 'current; Block-chain; Client selection; Federated learning; Global models; Heterogeneous sources; Large amounts; Learning approach; Local data; Monetization; Smart contract",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130391584

Consequently, B5G-Driven edge computing allows a growing volume of data to be collected from and transmitted among pervasive edge devices for big data analytics. The collected big data becomes the driving force of artificial intelligence (AI) by training high-quality machine learning (ML) models, which is followed by severe individual privacy leakage. Federated learning(FL) is then proposed to achieve privacy-preserving machine learning by avoiding the exchange of raw data. Unfortunately, several major issues remain outstanding. Centralized processing costs significant communication resources between cloud and edge while data falsification problems persist. In addition, the private data may be reconstructed by malicious participants by exploiting the context of model parameters in FL. To solve the identified problems, we propose to integrate blockchain-enabled FL with Wasserstein generative adversarial network (WGAN) enabled differential privacy (DP) to protect the model parameters of edge devices in B5G networks. Blockchain enables decentralized FL to reduce communication costs between cloud and edge while alleviating the data falsification issues, and it also provides an incentive mechanism to alleviate the data island issue in B5G-Driven edge computing. WGAN is used to generate controllable random noise complying with DP requirements, which is then injected to model parameters. WGAN-enabled DP is able to achieve an optimized trade-off between differential privacy protection and improved data utility of model parameters. Time delay analysis is conducted to show the efficiency of the proposed model. Extensive evaluation results from simulations demonstrate superior performances from aspects of convergence efficiency, accuracy, and data utility. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Blockchain; Differential privacy protection; Federated learning; Wasserstein generative adversarial nets","Big data; Blockchain; Crime; Data Analytics; Economic and social effects; Edge computing; Efficiency; Machine learning; Privacy-preserving techniques; Block-chain; Data utilities; Differential privacies; Differential privacy protection; Edge computing; Federated learning; Modeling parameters; Privacy preserving; Privacy protection; Wasserstein generative adversarial net; 5G mobile communication systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122215564

Emergency message dissemination is usually carried out by broadcasting. However, high vehicle density and mobility lead to challenges in message dissemination such as broadcasting storm and low probability of packet reception. This paper proposes a federated learning based blockchain-assisted message dissemination solution. Similar to the incentive-based Proof-of-Work consensus in blockchain, vehicles compete to become a relay node (miner) by processing the proposed Proof-of-Federated-Learning (PoFL) consensus which is embedded in the smart contract of blockchain. Both theoretical and practical analysis of the proposed solution are provided. Specifically, the proposed blockchain based federated learning results in more vehicles uploading their models in a given time, which can potentially lead to a more accurate model in less time as compared to the same solution without using blockchain. It also outperforms other blockchain approaches in reducing 65.2% of time delay in consensus, improving at least 8.2% message delivery rate and preserving privacy of neighbor vehicle more efficiently. The economic model to incentivize vehicles participating in federated learning and message dissemination is further analyzed using Stackelberg game. The analysis of asymptotic complexity proves PoFL as the most scalable solution compared to other consensus algorithms in vehicular networks. © 1967-2012 IEEE.","Blockchain; federated learning; smart contract","Biological systems; Data privacy; Economics; Fuzzy logic; Information dissemination; Motor transportation; Vehicles; Biological system modeling; Block-chain; Federated learning; Fuzzy-Logic; Message dissemination; Message exchange; Relay; Road safety; Vehicular networks; Smart contract",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120781237

Nowadays, with the arrival of the era of big data, the MIoT architecture has been transformed from cloud computing architecture to edge computing architecture.

In the current solutions, some use blockchain technology to solve data security problems while some use federated learning technology to solve privacy problems, but these methods neither combine with the special environment of the ocean nor consider the security of task publishers. In this article, we propose a secure sharing method of MIoT data under an edge computing framework based on federated learning and blockchain technology.

The blockchain serves as a decentralized way, which stores federated learning workers to achieve nontampering and security. We propose a concept of quality and reputation as the metrics of selection for federated learning workers. Meanwhile, we design a quality proof mechanism [proof of quality (PoQ)] and apply it to the blockchain, making the edge nodes recorded in the blockchain more high-quality.

However, since the intelligent edge services seriously rely on big data and computing resource, it challenges the traditional centralized data processing model. Data sharing is a promising way to tackle this problem, but some critical technical challenges still remain, such as fragile data privacy protection, inefficient data exchange and low quality of data fusion. To address these problems, a privacy-enhanced and intelligence-preserved data sharing system, name VFLChain, is proposed in this article. The proposed VFLChain is designed based on consortium blockchain and vertical federated learning, which can ensure trustworthy and secure data sharing without relying on any center platforms or third parties. Furthermore, a blockchain-assisted decentralized vertical federated learning is presented to adapt to the decentralized system and support privacy-preserved, intelligent and efficient edge data sharing, while improving quality of data through learning with different characteristic data samples.

Moreover, blockchain-based FL was recently proposed as a distributed FL architecture to achieve decentralized FL. In this setting, the chief that was responsible of the aggregation in FL is eliminated from the learning process. Instead, the workers collaborate amongst themselves to train the global model. This decentralization incurs additional delays and FL-based applications relying on it need to account for it in their deployments.

The operations of the monitoring and detection phases to assess the behavior of the workers are conducted in parallel for an improved decentralized FL deployment.

However, their participation is restrained due to potential leakage of sensitive and private data. Federated learning targets to address these issues by bringing the model to the device and keeping the data in place. Still, it suffers from inherent security issues such as malicious participation and unfair contribution. The central server may become a bottleneck as well as induce biased aggregation and incentives. This article proposes a blockchain assisted federated learning framework, which fosters honest participation with reduced overheads, facilitating fair contribution-based weighted incentivization. A new consensus mechanism named PoIS (Proof of Interpretation and Selection) is proposed based on honest clients&#x2019; contributions. PoIS uses model interpretation techniques for evaluating and calculating individual contributions. The aggregation of feature attributions in PoIS, is able to detect the adversaries, and the label-wise aggregation of attributions across the participants helps to define the prominent contributors. Further, we devise a credit function based on the contribution, relevance as well as the past performance for calculating incentives. Extensive experiments have been carried out for the proposed architecture with different settings, models, and datasets, to verify our claim. It successfully restricts the attack to less than 5%, and selects the prominent (top-k) contributors. Theoretical analysis provides the guarantee for byzantine-robust aggregation, in a malicious setting.

Recently, federated learning (FL) based intrusion detection systems (IDS) promote the detection of large-scale cyber-attacks in resource-constrained and heterogeneous industrial systems without exposing data to privacy issues. However, the inherent characteristics of the latter have led to problems such as a trusted validation and consensus of the federation, unreliability, and privacy protection of model upload. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel privacy-preserving secure framework, named PPSS, based on the use of blockchain-enabled FL with improved privacy, verifiability, and transparency. The PPSS framework adopts the permissioned-blockchain system to secure multi-party computation as well as to incentivize cross-silo FL based on a lightweight and energy-efficient consensus protocol named Proof-of-Federated Deep-Learning (PoFDL). Specifically, we design two federated stages for global model aggregation. The first stage uses differentially private training of Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) to enforce privacy protection of client updates, while the second stage uses PoFDL protocol to prove and add new model-containing blocks to the blockchain.

A secure training scheme is designed to mitigate cyber threats (e.g., man-in-the-middle-attack).

A key enabler for adoption of blockchain-based federated learning is how to select suitable participants to train models collaboratively. Selecting participants by storing and querying the metadata of data owners on blockchain could ensure the reliability of selected data owners, which is helpful to obtain high-quality models in FL. However, querying multi-dimensional metadata on blockchain needs to traverse every transaction in each block, making the query time-consuming. An efficient query method for multi-dimensional metadata in the blockchain for selecting participants in FL is absent and challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel data structure to improve the query efficiency within each block named MerkleRB-Tree. In detail, we leverage Minimal Bounding Rectangle (MBR) and bloom-filters for the query process of multi-dimensional continuous-valued attributes and discrete-valued attributes respectively. Furthermore, we migrate the idea of the skip list along with an MBR and a bloom filter at the head of each block to enhance the query efficiency for inter-blocks.

To further understand recent advances in blockchain-based FL (BFL) systems, this article aims to provide a systematic survey to deconstruct BFL systems. We propose a taxonomy of BFL systems following the lifecycle of FL tasks and divide them into three layers, i.e., the blockchain layer, the training layer, and the aggregation layer.

However, the security issues in federated learning have become hot-spots in the research area, such as privacy-preserving and poisoning attacks. This paper proposes a robust blockchained multi-layer decentralized federated learning (RBML-DFL) framework to ensure the federated learning's robustness. Firstly, by adopting the three-layered framework, the blockchain connects the federated learning components to secure the privacy and data safety of federated learning. Secondly, the proposed framework provides resilience on poisoning attacks to the central model compared to typical federated learning frameworks. Lastly, the decentralized structure associated with the blockchain tracing back mechanism can prevent the central server failure or mal-function compared to centralized federated learning. We evaluate and compare the proposed framework with other state-of-the-art federated learning frameworks on the accuracy, latency, and system robustness under poisoning attacks. The results show that the proposed RBML-DFL framework outperforms state-of-the-art baseline frameworks on all three metrics: accuracy, latency, and the robustness of the federated learning. © 2022 IEEE.","Blockchain; Federated learning; Poisoning attack; Robustness","Internet of things; Learning systems; Privacy-preserving techniques; Block-chain; Decentralised; Development and applications; Federated learning; Learning frameworks; Multi-layers; Poisoning attacks; Robustness; Security issues; State of the art; Blockchain",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140754838

Federated learning, as a technology that combines data value delivery and data privacy security, is widely concerned in the process of data sharing. However, currently federated learning is used within a single business system. In the process of crossdomain data sharing, how to ensure the data trust, model trust, and result trust of federated learning is still an urgent problem to be solved. To this end, we designed to use blockchain structure to record each behavior of data sharing. Based on its tamper-proof and traceability, combined with cryptography technology, we constructed an endogenous trusted architecture for crossdomain data sharing. In addition, a reverse auction node incentive mechanism based on high credit preference is designed to solve the common problems in data sharing, such as low enthusiasm of users in sharing, unstable data quality of contributions, and unreasonable distribution of data sharing benefits. Through theoretical analysis and experimental verification, it can be seen that the incentive mechanism designed in this paper can meet the authenticity, user rationality, and budget feasibility. On this basis, it can motivate users to participate in data sharing, improve the average quality of data shared by users, and ensure security and trustworthiness and resist malicious attacks to a certain extent. © 2022 Da Li et al.",,"Blockchain; Budget control; Data privacy; Air grounds; Block-chain; Cross-domain; Data Sharing; Distributed data; Incentive mechanism; Integrated networks; Mechanism-based; Network data; Sharing mechanism; Network security",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140140781

However, due to the concern of data privacy, devices are not willing to transmit their raw data to base stations (BSs) for machine learning training. Federated learning (FL) is a promising paradigm that can enable distributed machine learning while protecting data privacy by collaboratively training AI models without sharing raw data. But the traditional FL requires a central node to complete global model update which makes the traditional FL facing single point attack. Further, the traditional FL cannot allow the distributed model sharing among untrusted devices which results in low training efficiency on devices. Blockchain is a promising approach to address the above issues since it can establish a secure decentralized and transaction sharing environment for untrusted devices. In this paper, we integrate blockchain into FL to build a distributed model training and sharing platform, where distributed mobile devices execute local model training and base stations maintain blockchain-based model sharing. Moreover, in order to accelerate the establishment of blockchain, we design a lightweight consensus strategy based on a delegate committee. To select high-quality nodes to form delegate committee, we design a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based selection algorithm.

The procedure of exchanging medical information is increasingly concerned with data privacy. Many techniques have been offered for preserving data security. These techniques use approaches such as (Formula presented.) -anonymity, (Formula presented.) -diversity, and others. However, such solutions are vulnerable to attribute disclosure, homogeneity, and background knowledge risks due to their syntactic nature. In this work, we describe a safe and secure architecture and semantic approach for data sharing that is based on blockchain, local differential privacy (LDP), and federated learning (FL). The proposed framework generates an atmosphere devoid of trust in which data owners are no longer required to have trust in the controllers. The FL models enable the whole network to decentralize its data-driven learning. Interplanetary file system (IPFS) is used to provide data security in a distributed environment because each file in IPFS has a digital fingerprint that is computed using a cryptographic hash function on the file's whole contents. Due to the rigorous privacy guarantee, data owners no longer need to be worried about the security of their data. The proposed model's assessment parameters include latency, throughput, privacy, and accuracy.

However, it is still inadequate to learn the global model safely at the centralized aggregator, which is an essential part for the traditional FL architecture. Specifically, when using FL in radio access networks to enable edge intelligence, it is difficult for a central server, which belongs to a third party, to guarantee its credibility. Moreover, because the central server may cause a single point of failure, its reliability is also difficult to guarantee. Besides, a malicious participating node of FL may send ill parameters for model aggregation. In this article, we develop a blockchain assisted federated learning (BC-FL) framework, with aim to overcome the single point of failure caused by central server. Meanwhile, we propose to use blockchain to implement auditing of individual involved nodes to ensure the reliability of learning process. To avoid privacy leakage during the audit process to the greatest extent, we design a matching audit mechanism to realize efficient random matching audit process. A cryptocurrency free delegated byzantine fault tolerant (CF-DBFT) consensus mechanism is also designed to realize the low-latency distributed consensus of all nodes in the FL proces. We apply the proposed BC-FL framework to resolve the computing resource allocation problem at the edger servers in MEC network. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and performance superiority of the proposed BC-FL framework. Compared with legacy FL algorithm, the serving time of MEC servers and utilization of computing resource are increased by 35% and 48% respectively under our proposed BC-FL algorithm.

Finally, we design experiments to confirm the feasibility as well as the security of the framework. © 2021 IEEE.","Blockchain; Federated Learning; Inference Attack; Poisoning Attack","Digital storage; Learning systems; Privacy-preserving techniques; Block-chain; Central servers; Data silos; Decentralised; Federated learning; Inference attacks; Machine-learning; Poisoning attacks; Privacy preserving; Security community; Blockchain",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132368582

Under the condition of data supervision, federated learning, as a distributed machine learning, aims to protect data while training models through collaboration among all parties to achieve data sharing and improve model quality. However, there are still some issues. For instance, the lack of trust between the participants makes it impossible to establish a secure and reliable sharing mechanism. In addition, how to fairly share the benefits generated by the model, identify honest participants and punish malicious participants is still a challenge. In this paper, we propose a new federated learning scheme based on blockchain architecture for federated learning data sharing. Moreover, an incentive mechanism based on reputation points and Shaply values is proposed to improve the sustainability of the federated learning system, which provides a credible participation mechanism for data sharing based on federated learning and fair incentives.

However, this technique raises privacy concerns about patients' health data. More recently, the concept of federal learning (FL) has been set up to protect mobile user data privacy. Compared to traditional machine learning, federated learning requires a decentralized distribution system to enhance trust for UAVs.

However, it raises new privacy concerns due to the risk of privacy-sensitive medical data leakage. It is not until recently that the privacy-preserving FL (PPFL) has been introduced as a solution to ensure the privacy of training processes. Unfortunately, most existing PPFL schemes are highly dependent on complex cryptographic mechanisms or fail to guarantee the accuracy of training models. Besides, there has been little research on the fairness of the payment procedure in the PPFL with incentive mechanisms. To address the above concerns, we first construct an efficient non-interactive designated decryptor function encryption (NDD-FE) scheme to protect the privacy of training data while maintaining high communication performance. We then propose a blockchain-based PPFL framework with fair payment for medical image detection, namely ESB-FL, by combining the NDD-FE and an elaborately designed blockchain. ESB-FL not only inherits the characteristics of the NDD-FE scheme, but it also ensures the interests of each participant.

The LML block updates are verified in the second phase through a proposed distributed consensus mechanism. Lastly, through 6G communication services, the channel dynamics are modelled as a Markov chain process to reduce end-to-end delay of local BC propagation updates at the edge that improves the V2X system throughput.

Thus, researchers have shifted towards network designs that incorporate beyond 5G (B5G) networks for UAV designs. However, UAVs are resource-constrained, with limited power and battery, and thus centralized cloud-centric models are not suitable. Moreover, as exchanged data is through open channels, privacy and security issues exist. Federated learning (FL) allows data to be trained on local nodes, preserving privacy and improving network communication. However, sharing of local updates is required through a trusted consensus mechanism. Thus, blockchain (BC)-based FL schemes for UAVs allow trusted exchange of FL updates among UAV swarms and GS. To date, limited research has been carried out on the integration of BC and FL in UAV management. The proposed survey addresses the gap and presents a solution taxonomy of BC-based FL in UAVs for B5G networks due to the open problem. This paper presents a reference architecture and compares its potential benefits over traditional BC-based UAV networks. Open issues and challenges are discussed, with possible future directions. Finally, a logistics case study of BC-based FL-oriented UAVs in 6G networks is presented. The survey aims to aid researchers in developing potential UAV solutions with the key integrating principles over a diverse set of application verticals. © 2013 IEEE.","6G; Beyond 5G networks; blockchain; federated learning; unmanned aerial vehicles","Antennas; Data privacy; Drones; Mobile security; Queueing networks; Surveys; Taxonomies; 6g; Beyond 5g network; Block-chain; Computational modelling; Federated learning; Ground stations; Health care operations; Healthcare monitoring; Security; Surveillance operations; 5G mobile communication systems",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127024716

However, patients’ EMRs are usually distributed in the databases of multiple medical institutions. Due to the insecurity of the network environment and distrust of other parties, EMR owners worry about data insecurity and privacy leakage, which makes sharing with other parties difficult. Patients worry about the loose control of their health data as well. To solve this problem, we present a solution for the EMRs data sharing based on blockchain and federated learning, which will provide data security and patients’ privacy. Firstly, we propose a method for EMRs data retrieval records and sharing records as transaction records adding to the blockchain, and design the two algorithm processes, respectively. Secondly, federated learning is used to help EMRs data owners to build a model based on the original data. The data owner only shares the model instead of the original data. Finally, by security and privacy analytics, we analyzed the advantages and influence of the proposed model.

A major novelty of the IIoT is the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are treated as an efficient remote sensing technique to gather data from large regions. UAVs are commonly employed in the industrial sector to solve several issues and help decision making. But the strict regulations leading to data privacy possibly hinder data sharing across autonomous UAVs. Federated learning (FL) becomes a recent advancement of machine learning (ML) which aims to protect user data. In this aspect, this study designs federated learning with blockchain assisted image classification model for clustered UAV networks (FLBIC-CUAV) on IIoT environment. The proposed FLBIC-CUAV technique involves three major processes namely clustering, blockchain enabled secure communication and FL based image classification. For UAV cluster construction process, beetle swarm optimization (BSO) algorithm with three input parameters is designed to cluster the UAVs for effective communication. In addition, blockchain enabled secure data transmission process take place to transmit the data from UAVs to cloud servers.

First, a two-layered architecture is proposed that consists of two types of blockchains: local model update chain (LMUC) assisted by device-to-device (D2D) communication and global model update chain (GMUC) supporting task sharding. The D2D-assisted LMUC is designed to chronologically and efficiently record all of the local model training results, which can help to form long-term reputations of local devices. The GMUC is proposed to provide both security and efficiency by preventing mobile edge computing nodes from malfunctioning and dividing them into logically isolated FL task-specific chains.

However, it is still faced with the dilemma of lacking enough data sources in the current practice of artificial intelligence. In this context, distributed machine learning aggregates edge devices' raw data into a parameter server for model training, but it easily leads to data privacy leakage and causes excessive storage overhead. In particular, federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning framework that stores data locally, which can effectively protect the data privacy of edge intelligent nodes. According to client settings, FL can be classified into two types: cross-device FL and cross-silo FL. In cross-device FL, a central entity acts as the central parameter server, which is also the owner of the global model. Meanwhile, the participating nodes as the clients to perform local training. In cross-silo FL, all participating nodes act as the clients to perform local training. In addition, they are also the owners of the global model and can make use of the trained global model. In this paper, we focus on cross-device FL, in which intelligence edge devices can provide model training services by sensing the raw data from IoT devices such as intelligence vehicles, smartphones etc. Most of the existing cross-device FL implements model aggregated by uploading the intermediate parameters of model training to the parameter server. There are two problems in this process. On the one hand, there is privacy leakage of intermediate parameters. The existing privacy protection schemes usually use differential privacy to add the noise on intermediate parameters, but excessive noise will reduce the quality of the global model. On the other hand, the training process of node self-interest and full autonomy may lead to malicious nodes uploading false parameters or low-quality models, thus affect the aggregation processes and model quality. In this paper, the centralized parameter server in federated learning is constructed as a decentralized parameter aggregation chain, and the intermediate parameters of the model training process recorded on the blockchain as evidence. Moreover, the cooperative nodes are encouraged to verify the model parameters and punish the participating nodes who upload false parameters or low-quality models so as to restrict their self-interest. In view of above challenges, we take the model quality as the metric to dynamically adjust privacy noise of intermediate parameters and propose a federated adaptive (FedAdp) model aggregation algorithm. The prototype development and experimental simulations show that the proposed FedAdp model aggregation algorithm can achieve higher accuracy of aggregation model when occur poisoning attack. By dynamically adjusting the Laplace random noise, it's realized the tradeoff between privacy protection and the accuracy error of the aggregation model. The experiment of blockchain performance confirmed that our scheme has good practicability. It is proved that the model can not only enhance the mutual trust between the participating nodes of federated learning, but also prevent the privacy disclosure of intermediate parameters, so as to realize the federated learning model with enhanced trust and privacy protection. © 2021, Science Press.

As a complementary, blockchain technology is used in recent literature to make FL secure. However, existing blockchain-based FL (BFL) solutions do not perform well when data in a BFL cluster are sparse. A direct solution is to collect as many devices as possible to establish a large BFL cluster. However, these devices may locate in geographically distant areas and be separated by great distance, which further results in high communication latency. The high latency will lead to BFL's low system efficiency due to frequent communications in the blockchain consensus. In this article, we propose that the large cluster should be divided into multiple smaller clusters, each in its own geographical area and organized with a BFL. In this context, we propose CFL, a cross-cluster FL system facilitated by the cross-chain technique. CFL connects multiple BFL clusters, where only a few aggregated updates are transmitted over long distances across clusters, thus improving the system efficiency.

Since it is limited by the requirement of protecting privacy and trade secrets, data can't be effectively shared among enterprises. Federated learning is an effective method to solve this problem, but there are some performance bottlenecks, information security issues and data trust issues still existed, which need to be improved in combination with other advanced technologies to meet the practical requirements. This paper combines the blockchain technology with federated learning technology, and uses decentralized blockchain system to replace the traditional centralized federated learning architecture. We adopt training method of updating models to achieve machine learning. In this way, we can avoid transmission of intermediate computing data and achieve mechanism of node access, model evaluation, motivation and audit with combination of block chain.

The existing asynchronous federated learning can effectively solve the problems such as waste of computing resources and low training efficiency caused by synchronous learning. However, it aggregates local models from different nodes and updates the global model through the central server, which makes it endogenously subject to the centralized trust mode and suffers from some issues such as single point of failure and privacy leakage. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based privacy-preserving asynchronous federated learning, which ensures the trustability by storing local models into the blockchain and generating the global model through the consensus algorithm. In order to guarantee the privacy of federated learning and improve the model utility, the exponential mechanism of differential privacy is used to select model gradients with high contribution at high probability, and a lower privacy budget is allocated to ensure the model privacy. In addition, in order to solve the problem of clock desynchronization in asynchronous federated learning, we propose a two-factor adjustment mechanism to further improve the global model utility. Finally, theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that our proposed scheme can effectively guarantee the trustability and privacy of the asynchronous federated learning while improving the model utility. © 2021, Science China Press.

The IoT can leverage advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms for its applications. However, given the fact of massive data, which is stored at a central cloud server, adopting centralized machine learning algorithms is not a viable option due to immense computation cost and privacy leakage issues. Given such conditions, blockchain can be leveraged to enhance the privacy of IoT networks by making them decentralized without any central authority. Nevertheless, the sensitive and massive data that is stored in distributive fashion, leveraged it for application purpose, is still a challenging task. To overcome this challenging task, federated learning (FL), which is a new breed of ML is the most promising solution that brings learning to the end devices without sharing the private data to the central server. In the FL mechanism, the central server act as an orchestrator to start the FL learning process, and only model parameters' updates are shared between end devices and the central orchestrator. Although FL can provide better privacy and data management, it is still in the development phase and has not been adopted by various communities due to its unknown privacy issues.

Traditionally, AI techniques often require centralized data collection and training in a single entity, e.g., an MEC server, which is now becoming a weak point due to data privacy concerns and high overhead of raw data communications. In this context, federated learning (FL) has been proposed to provide collaborative data training solutions, by coordinating multiple mobile devices to train a shared AI model without directly exposing their underlying data, which enjoys considerable privacy enhancement.

Recent industrial research works introduce the sovereign-identity system, where Blockchain becomes a decentralized component to establish a self-certified identity and to avoid a centralized trust third party. Hence, the classification of distributed transactions with respect to identity validation across several users becomes more challenging, especially because of the massive and sensitive identities that are issued through many users and IoT devices and that are used to validate transactions. In this context, it is important to identify and classify the malicious and non-malicious types of transactions. Our proposed method achieves the target of identity classifications from variety of transaction data.

As a promising solution of decentralization, scalability and security, leveraging blockchain in FL has attracted much attention in recent years. However, the traditional consensus mechanisms designed for blockchain like Proof of Work (PoW) would cause extreme resource consumption, which reduces the efficiency of FL greatly, especially when the participating devices are wireless and resource-limited. In order to address device asynchrony and anomaly detection in FL while avoiding the extra resource consumption caused by blockchain, this paper introduces a framework for empowering FL using Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based blockchain systematically (DAG-FL). Accordingly, DAG-FL is first introduced from a three-layer architecture in details, and then two algorithms DAG-FL Controlling and DAG-FL Updating are designed running on different nodes to elaborate the operation of DAG-FL consensus mechanism. The extensive simulations show that DAG-FL can achieve the better performance in terms of training efficiency and model accuracy compared with the typical existing on-device federated learning systems as the benchmarks. © 2021 IEEE.",,"Anomaly detection; Benchmarking; Blockchain; Efficiency; Graph theory; Learning systems; Asynchrony; Block-chain; Decentralisation; Direct acyclic graphs; Distributed characteristics; Global coordination; Global models; Graph-based; Proof of work; Resources consumption; Graphic methods",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115719682

In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving proof-of-location mechanism using blockchain to meet these conditions. Specifically, the proposed scheme utilizes a Threshold Identity-Based Encryption (TIBE) system for the generation of secret shares, such that each anonymous location proof can only be verified with at least a threshold number of participants. In addition, the proposed scheme exploits a cuckoo filter for the secure and efficient maintenance and dissemination of location proofs.

However, privacy issues during data collection for ML tasks raise extensive concerns. To solve this issue, synchronous federated learning (FL) is proposed, which enables the central servers and end devices to maintain the same ML models by only exchanging model parameters. However, the diversity of computing power and data sizes leads to a significant difference in local training data consumption, and thereby causes the inefficiency of FL. Besides, the centralized processing of FL is vulnerable to single-point failure and poisoning attacks. Motivated by this, we propose an innovative method, federated learning with asynchronous convergence (FedAC) considering a staleness coefficient, while using a blockchain network instead of the classic central server to aggregate the global model. It avoids real-world issues such as interruption by abnormal local device training failure, dedicated attacks, etc. By comparing with the baseline models, we implement the proposed method on a real-world dataset, MNIST, and achieve accuracy rates of 98.96% and 95.84% in both horizontal and vertical FL modes, respectively.

By executing FL, a set of agents can jointly train a model without sharing their datasets with each other, or a third-party. This makes FL particularly suitable for settings where data privacy is desired. At the same time, concealing training data gives attackers an opportunity to inject backdoors into the trained model. It has been shown that an attacker can inject backdoors to the trained model during FL, and then can leverage the backdoor to make the model misclassify later. Several works tried to alleviate this threat by designing robust aggregation functions. However, given more sophisticated attacks are developed over time, which by-pass the existing defenses, we approach this problem from a complementary angle in this work. Particularly, we aim to discourage backdoor attacks by detecting, and punishing the attackers, possibly after the end of training phase. To this end, we develop a hybrid blockchain-based FL framework that uses smart contracts to automatically detect, and punish the attackers via monetary penalties. Our framework is general in the sense that, any aggregation function, and any attacker detection algorithm can be plugged into it. We conduct experiments to demonstrate that our framework preserves the communication-efficient nature of FL, and provide empirical results to illustrate that it can successfully penalize attackers by leveraging our novel attacker detection algorithm. © 2021 ACM.","backdoor attacks; ethereum; federated averaging; federated learning; hybrid blockchain; hyperledger; machine learning","Blockchain; Signal detection; Aggregation functions; Backdoors; By pass; Detection algorithm; Robust aggregation; Third parties; Training data; Training phase; Privacy by design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104991704

Therefore, in this article, to ensure client data privacy, we propose a blockchain-based federated learning approach for device failure detection in IIoT. First, we present a platform architecture of blockchain-based federated learning systems for failure detection in IIoT, which enables verifiable integrity of client data. In the architecture, each client periodically creates a Merkle tree in which each leaf node represents a client data record, and stores the tree root on a blockchain.

In addition, to motivate clients to participate in federated learning, a smart contact-based incentive mechanism is designed depending on the size and the centroid distance of client data used in local model training.

The only data exchanged is the gradient of the model or the updated model (i.e., the local model update).

However, the federated edge learning still faces the following critical challenges: (i) difficulty in avoiding unreliable edge devices acting as workers for federated edge learning, and (ii) lack of efficient learning task assignment schemes among task publishers and workers.

To help manufacturers develop a smart home system, we design a federated learning (FL) system leveraging a reputation mechanism to assist home appliance manufacturers to train a machine learning model based on customers' data. Then, manufacturers can predict customers' requirements and consumption behaviors in the future. The working flow of the system includes two stages: in the first stage, customers train the initial model provided by the manufacturer using both the mobile phone and the mobile-edge computing (MEC) server. Customers collect data from various home appliances using phones, and then they download and train the initial model with their local data. After deriving local models, customers sign on their models and send them to the blockchain. In case customers or manufacturers are malicious, we use the blockchain to replace the centralized aggregator in the traditional FL system. Since records on the blockchain are untampered, malicious customers or manufacturers' activities are traceable. In the second stage, manufacturers select customers or organizations as miners for calculating the averaged model using received models from customers. By the end of the crowdsourcing task, one of the miners, who is selected as the temporary leader, uploads the model to the blockchain. To protect customers' privacy and improve the test accuracy, we enforce differential privacy (DP) on the extracted features and propose a new normalization technique.

We consider the possibility to extend a set of supported models by introducing the oracle service and exploring the usability of blockchain-based architecture. The investigated architecture combines an oracle service with a Hyperledger Fabric chaincode. We compared two logistic regression implementations in Go language—a pure chaincode and an oracle service—at various data (2–32 k instances) and network (3–13 peers) sizes. Experiments were run to assess the performance of blockchain-based model inference using 2D synthetic and EEG eye state datasets for a supervised machine learning detection task. The benchmarking results showed that the impact on performance is acceptable with the median overhead of oracle service reaching 2–4%, depending on the dimensionality of the dataset. The overhead tends to diminish at large dataset sizes with the runtime depending on the network size linearly, where additional peers increased the runtime by 6.3 and 6.6 s for 2D and EEG datasets, respectively.

Most existing blockchain assisted FL (BFL) frameworks have employed a third-party blockchain network to decentralize the model aggregation process. However, the decentralized model aggregation is vulnerable to pooling and collusion attacks from the third-party blockchain network. Driven by this issue, we propose a novel BFL framework that features the integration of training and mining at the client side. In our framework, the client first transmits its trained model to other clients, performs global aggregation upon receiving others' models, and competes to mine a block for aggregated model verification without the intervention of any third-party blockchain network. Considering the model transmission over time-varying wireless channels, we propose a dynamic training client scheduling to meet stringent latency requirement in FL, where clients with qualified channel conditions are scheduled to train their models in each communication round. Furthermore, we formulate a joint optimization problem of the training client scheduling and dynamic resource allocation (i.e., the transmit and computation power at the client side) under the constraint of long-term time-average (LTA) energy consumption. The objective of this optimization problem is to maximize the LTA training data size and thereby optimize the learning performance of FL.

In FL, a group of participants train their local models using their private data, and then upload the locally trained models to a central server that completes the model aggregation process. Compared with the traditional ML that needs to upload private data of the participants to a server for a centralized training, FL protects the data privacy of participants. However, the existing FL has several drawbacks: FL relies to a large extent on a single central server that takes the risk of single point of failure; it lacks a fair and effective reward system to prevent malicious participants from damage the learning process. To overcome these drawbacks, this paper proposes a new FL system based on blockchain (BC). With BC, we introduce a voting-based reputation mechanism to guarantee that the locally trained models from effective FL participants (other than malicious FL participants) can be selected to improve the efficiency of model aggregation. Besides that, we combine the reputation system with a reward mechanism to dynamically adjust the reward shares that can be fairly allocated to the participants. This can attract more FL participants to participate in the learning process, so that the system can run stably for a long time.

Moreover, the centralized architecture has some inherent issues, such as single point of failure, overload requests, intolerable delay, etc. In this article, we propose Bift: a fully decentralized machine learning system combined with federated learning and blockchain to provide a privacy-preserving ML process for CAVs. Bift enables distributed CAVs to train machine learning models locally using their own driving data and then upload the local models to the nearest mobile edge computing node (MECN) to get a better global model. More importantly, Bift provides a consensus algorithm named PoFL to resist possible adversaries. We evaluate the performance of Bift and demonstrate that Bift is scalable and robust, and can defend against malicious attacks. © 2021 IEEE.","blockchain; connected and autonomous vehicles; consensus algorithm; edge computing; federated learning","Blockchain; Learning algorithms; Machine components; Machine learning; Mobile edge computing; Network security; Privacy-preserving techniques; Autonomous driving; Autonomous Vehicles; Block-chain; Connected and autonomous vehicle; Consensus algorithms; Edge computing; Federated learning; Federated learning system; Machine learning algorithms; Vehicular networks; Autonomous vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126112036

This integration with end users produces large-scale and heterogeneous data sources that demand machine learning (ML)-based data analytics for decision-making and to provide security against ML and data privacy attacks. The development of privacy-aware ML models within a federated learning (FL) ecosystem can empower an entire network to learn from data in a decentralized manner. In this article, we propose a differentially privacy blockchain-based explainable FL (DP-BFL) framework by harnessing the ever-evolving power of SM 3.0 networks. This framework permits any Internet empowered device to partake and contribute data to a global privacy preserved model. In this framework, participants will upload the differentially private local updates to the miners of blockchain, where the local updates will be evaluated and rewarded. The experimental results obtained from real-world datasets, namely, SM 3.0 and MNIST, demonstrated that the proposed framework could achieve high utility, enhanced privacy, and elevated efficiency. More Specifically, the experimental analysis of our proposed framework reveals the following two key properties. First, our proposed DP-BFL yields noticeable performance improvements in the applied learning models with high privacy and comparable utility levels, in terms of accuracy and f-measure metrics, to a standard FL and centralized learning approaches under the restriction of privacy preservation. Second, given a certain number of the malicious entities, DP-BFL allowed an enhanced recognition of users' preferences in the SM 3.0 dataset and precise prediction of images' class in the MNIST dataset while mitigating the impact of the malicious entities' poisoned updates. Moreover, as the proposed DP-BFL attains DP on the local model's update, it is considered the same as the standard FL-based setting, along with some kinds of privacy preservation on the uploaded model's updates.

Moreover, FL is feasible for scenarios (e.g., autonomous cars) where an enormous amount of data is generated every day. Transferring only local model updates in the case of FL is highly communication-efficient compared to transferring all data in the case of centralized machine learning (ML). Although FL offers many advantages, it also has some challenges. A malicious aggregation server can infer device information via local model updates. Another downside of FL is the centralized aggregation server that can malfunction due to an attack or physical damage. To address these issues, we propose a novel Structured Transparency empowered cross-silo Federated Learning on the Blockchain (ST-BFL) framework.

Techniques for learning models from decentralized data must properly handle two natures of such data, namely privacy and massive engagement. Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach for such a learning task since the technique learns models from data without exposing privacy. However, traditional FL methods assume that the participating mobile devices are honest volunteers. This assumption makes traditional FL methods unsuitable for applications where two kinds of participants are engaged: 1) self-interested participants who, without economical stimulus, are reluctant to contribute their computing resources unconditionally, and 2) malicious participants who send corrupt updates to disrupt the learning process. This paper proposes Refiner, a reliable federated learning system for tackling the challenges introduced by massive engagements of self-interested and malicious participants. Refiner is built upon Ethereum, a public blockchain platform. To engage self-interested participants, we introduce an incentive mechanism which rewards each participant in terms of the amount of its training data and the performance of its local updates. To handle malicious participants, we propose an audit scheme which employs a committee of randomly chosen validators for punishing them with no reward and preclude corrupt updates from the global model.

Previous works focus on data sharing between vehicles, but a large amount of data will lead to redundant transmission and network congestion. In addition, security and privacy issues prevent these nodes from participating in the sharing process. Knowledge is extracted from data through machine learning (ML) and shared in the form of small-scale well-trained model parameters, which improves collaborative learning more effectively and relieves network pressure. While traditional ML algorithms are not suitable for distributed IoV with local characteristics. Based on this, this paper first divides the vehicles into multiple regions and proposes a Regional Federated Learning (RFL) framework, in which all regions maintain their own learning models, i.e. knowledge. We design a reputation mechanism to measure the reliability of vehicles participating in RFL. To address the security challenges brought by the untrusted centralized trading market, we propose a blockchain-enhanced knowledge trading framework, in which an authorized market agency coordinates the trading quickly. We model the optimal pricing mechanism as a non-cooperative game, taking into account the competition among all knowledge providers. Numerical simulation shows that the proposed reputation mechanism improves the accuracy of knowledge up to 18%, and the optimal knowledge pricing mechanism effectively increases the utility of market. ©2021 IEEE.","Blockchain; Knowledge trading; Pricing mechanism; Regional Federated Learning; Reputation","Commerce; Costs; Game theory; Learning systems; Traffic congestion; Vehicle transmissions; Block-chain; Data Sharing; Environmental data; Knowledge trading; Large amounts of data; Pricing mechanism; Regional federated learning; Reputation; Reputation mechanism; Transmission congestion; Blockchain",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119366005

Recently, blockchain is considered a promising solution that can transform FL training into a decentralized manner and improve security during training. However, traditional consensus mechanisms and architecture for blockchain can hardly handle the large-scale FL task due to the huge resource consumption, limited throughput, and high communication complexity. To this end, this paper proposes a two-layer blockchain-driven FL framework, called as ChainsFL, which is composed of multiple Raft-based shard networks (layer-1) and a Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based main chain (layer-2) where layer-1 limits the scale of each shard for a small range of information exchange, and layer-2 allows each shard to update and share the model in parallel and asynchronously. Furthermore, FL procedure in a blockchain manner is designed, and the refined DAG consensus mechanism to mitigate the effect of stale models is proposed. In order to provide a proof-of-concept implementation and evaluation, the shard blockchain base on Hyperledger Fabric is deployed on the self-made gateway as layer-1, and the self-developed DAG-based main chain is deployed on the personal computer as layer-2.

Hence, a human oracle is required to gradually annotate the data patterns at run-time to improve the models' learning behavior, through an active learning strategy in form of User Feedback Process (UFP). Consequently, it is worth to note that during UFP there may exist malicious content that may subject the learning model to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, more so, manipulative attacks. We argue in this position paper, that there are instances during incremental learning, where the local data model may present wrong output, if retraining is done using data that has already been subjected to adversarial attack. We propose a Distributed Interactive Secure Federated Learning (DISFL) framework that utilizes UFP in the edge and fog node, that subsequently increases the amount of labelled personal local data for the ML model during incremental training. Furthermore, the DISFL framework addresses data privacy by leveraging federated learning, where only the model's knowledge is moved to a global unit, herein referred to as Collective Intelligence Node (CIN). During incremental learning, this would then allow the creation of an immutable chain of data that has to be trained, which in its entirety is tamper-free while increasing trust between parties. With a degree of certainty, this approach counters adversarial manipulation during incremental learning in active learning context at the same time strengthens data privacy, while reducing the computation costs. © 2020 ACM.","adversarial; blockchain; Federated learning; incremental training; privacy","Blockchain; Human form models; Internet of things; Knowledge management; Privacy by design; Supervised learning; Active learning strategies; Collective intelligences; Computation costs; Degree of certainty; Incremental learning; Incremental training; Learning behavior; Supervised machine learning; Learning systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117542476

Relying on a renewal reward approach, we develop a mathematical framework that features the controllable network and BFL parameters (e.g., the retransmission limit, block size, block arrival rate, and the frame sizes) so as to capture their impact on the system-level performance. More importantly, our rigorous analysis of oVML system dynamics quantifies the end-to-end delay with BFL, which provides important insights into deriving optimal block arrival rate by considering communication and consensus delays.

FL is an emerging collaborative machine learning technique that trains a model across multiple devices or servers holding private data samples without exchanging their data. The locally trained results are aggregated by a centralized server in a privacy-preserving way. However, there is an assumption where the centralized server is trustworthy, which is impractical. Fortunately, blockchain technology has opened a new era of data exchange among trustless strangers because of its decentralized architecture and cryptography-supported techniques. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, the author proposes a novel design of a smart agent inspired by the smart contract concept. Specifically, based on the proposed smart agent, a fully decentralized, privacy-preserving and fair deep learning blockchain-FL framework is designed, where the agent network is consistent with the blockchain network and each smart agent is a participant in the FL task. During the whole training process, both the data and the model are not at the risk of leakage. Findings: A demonstration of the proposed architecture is designed to train a neural network. Finally, the implementation of the proposed architecture is conducted in the Ethereum development, showing the effectiveness and applicability of the design. Originality/value: The author aims to investigate the feasibility and practicality of linking the three areas together, namely, multi-agent system, FL and blockchain. A blockchain-FL framework, which is based on a smart agent system, has been proposed. The author has made several contributions to the state-of-the-art. First of all, a concrete design of a smart agent model is proposed, inspired by the smart contract concept in blockchain. The smart agent is autonomous and is able to disseminate, verify the information and execute the supported protocols.

Then, a fully decentralized, privacy-preserving and smart agent blockchain-FL framework has been proposed, where a smart agent acts as both a peer in a blockchain network and a participant in a FL task at the same time. Finally, a demonstration to train an artificial neural network is implemented to prove the effectiveness of the proposed framework. © 2020, Zhizhao Zhang, Tianzhi Yang and Yuan Liu.","Blockchain; Federated learning; Smart agent",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102575968

At the helm of the advent of deep learning is the proliferation of data from diverse data sources ranging from Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices to self-driving automobiles. Tapping into this unlimited reservoir of information presents the problem of finding quality data out of a myriad of irrelevant ones, which to this day, has been a significant issue in data science with a direct ramification of this being the inability to generate quality ML models for useful predictive analysis. Edge computing has been deemed a solution to some of issues such as privacy, security, data silos and latency, as it ventures to bring cloud computing services closer to end-nodes. A new form of edge computing known as edge-AI attempts to bring ML, AI, and predictive analytics services closer to the data source (end devices). In this paper, we investigate an approach to bring edge-AI to end-nodes through a shared machine learning model powered by the blockchain technology and a federated learning framework called iFLBC edge. Our approach addresses the issue of the scarcity of relevant data by devising a mechanism known as the Proof of Common Interest (PoCI) to sieve out relevant data from irrelevant ones. The relevant data is trained on a model, which is then aggregated along with other models to generate a shared model that is stored on the blockchain. The aggregated model is downloaded by members of the network which they can utilize for the provision of edge intelligence to end-users. This way, AI can be more ubiquitous as members of the iFLBC network can provide intelligence services to end-users. © 2020 IEEE.",,"Big data; Blockchain; Deep learning; Edge computing; Internet of things; Learning systems; Polonium compounds; Predictive analytics; Speech recognition; Aggregated modeling; Cloud computing services; Common interests; Edge intelligence; Intelligence services; Internet of Things (IOT); Learning frameworks; Machine learning models; Network security",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087866297

However, the bandwidth, security and privacy issues hinder data providers from participating in the data sharing process. In addition, due to the intermittent and unreliable communications in IoV, the reliability and efficiency of data sharing need to be further enhanced. In this paper, we propose a new architecture based on federated learning to relieve transmission load and address privacy concerns of providers. To enhance the security and reliability of model parameters, we develop a hybrid blockchain architecture which consists of the permissioned blockchain and the local Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Moreover, we propose an asynchronous federated learning scheme by adopting Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for node selection to improve the efficiency. The reliability of shared data is also guaranteed by integrating learned models into blockchain and executing a two-stage verification.

Improper traction or braking operation made by drivers will increase the longitudinal impact force to trains and causes the train decoupling, severely affecting the safe operations of trains. It is quite desirable to replace the manual control with intelligent control in heavy haul rail systems. Traditional machine learning-based intelligent control methods suffer from insufficient data. Due to lacking effective incentives and trust, data from different rail lines or operators cannot be shared directly. In this paper, we propose an approach on blockchain-based federated learning to implement asynchronous collaborative machine learning between distributed agents that own data. This method performs distributed machine learning without a trusted central server. The blockchain smart contract is used to realize the management of the entire federated learning. Using the historical driving data collected from real heavy haul rail systems, the learning agent in the federated learning method adopts a support vector machine (SVM) based intelligent control model. To deal with the imbalanced traction and braking data, we optimize the classic SVM model via assigning different penalty factors to the majority and minority classes. The data set are mapped to a high dimension using kernel functions to make it linearly separable. We construct a mixing kernel function composed of polynomial and radial basis function (RBF) kernel functions, which uses a dynamic weight factor changing with train speeds to improve the model accuracy. The simulation results demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our proposed intelligent control method. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

For IoHT data to be acceptable by stakeholders, applications that incorporate the IoHT must have a provision for data provenance, in addition to the accuracy, security, integrity, and quality of data. To protect the privacy and security of IoHT data, federated learning (FL) and differential privacy (DP) have been proposed, where private IoHT data can be trained at the owner's premises. Recent advancements in hardware GPUs even allow the FL process within smartphone or edge devices having the IoHT attached to their edge nodes. Although some of the privacy concerns of IoHT data are addressed by FL, fully decentralized FL is still a challenge due to the lack of training capability at all federated nodes, the scarcity of high-quality training datasets, the provenance of training data, and the authentication required for each FL node. In this paper, we present a lightweight hybrid FL framework in which blockchain smart contracts manage the edge training plan, trust management, and authentication of participating federated nodes, the distribution of global or locally trained models, the reputation of edge nodes and their uploaded datasets or models. The framework also supports the full encryption of a dataset, the model training, and the inferencing process. Each federated edge node performs additive encryption, while the blockchain uses multiplicative encryption to aggregate the updated model parameters. To support the full privacy and anonymization of the IoHT data, the framework supports lightweight DP. This framework was tested with several deep learning applications designed for clinical trials with COVID-19 patients. We present here the detailed design, implementation, and test results, which demonstrate strong potential for wider adoption of IoHT-based health management in a secure way. © 2020 IEEE.","Blockchain; Federated learning; Homomorphic encryption; Internet of Health Things; Provenance","Authentication; Blockchain; Deep learning; Health; Privacy by design; Program processors; Detailed design; Differential privacies; Health management; Learning approach; Privacy and security; Privacy concerns; Quality of data; Trust management; Cryptography",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099097259

However, due to its decentralized nature, no one can monitor workers&#x2019; behavior, and they may thus deviate protocols (e.g., participating without updating any models). To solve this problem, many researchers have proposed blockchain-enabled FL to reward workers (or users) with cryptocurrencies to encourage workers to follow the protocols. However, there is a lack of theoretical discussions concerning how such rewards impact workers&#x2019; behavior and how much should be given to workers. In this paper, we propose a mechanism-design-oriented FL protocol on a public blockchain network. Mechanism design (MD) is often used to make a rule intended to achieve a specific goal. With MD in mind, we introduce the concept of competition into blockchain-based FL so that only workers who have contributed well can obtain rewards, which naturally prevents workers from deviating from the protocol. We then mathematically answer the following questions with contest theory, a novel field of study in economics: i) What behavior will workers take?; ii) how much effort should workers exert to maximize their profits?; iii) how many workers should be rewarded?; and iv) what is the best proportion for reward distribution?.

To bridge the gaps, we first propose a blockchain-empowered secure FEL system with a hierarchical blockchain framework consisting of a main chain and subchains. This framework can achieve scalable and flexible decentralized FEL by individually manage local model updates or model sharing records for performance isolation. A Proof-of-Verifying consensus scheme is then designed to remove low-quality model updates and manage qualified model updates in a decentralized and secure manner, thereby achieving secure FEL. To improve communication efficiency of the blockchain-empowered FEL, a gradient compression scheme is designed to generate sparse but important gradients to reduce communication overhead without compromising accuracy, and also further strengthen privacy preservation of training data. The security analysis and numerical results indicate that the proposed schemes can achieve secure, scalable, and communication-efficient decentralized FEL. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Blockchain; Communication efficiency; Federated edge learning; Gradient compression; Security","Data privacy; Efficiency; Learning systems; Block-chain; Communication efficiency; Decentralised; Federated edge learning; Gradient compression; Learning techniques; Local model; Model sharing; Model updates; Security; Blockchain",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097195294

However, during the model transmission of the original FL protocol, there is no security guarantee towards the training results. Thus, every step during model uploading phase can be attacked by malicious attackers. To address such threat, we propose a new federated learning architecture by taking the advantages of blockchain into account. The proposed architecture includes two-phase design. The first phase is a numerical evaluation, which can prevent the malicious devices from being selected.

Such misbehavior are not auditable and parameter server may compute incorrectly due to single point failure. Furthermore, FL has no incentive to attract sufficient distributed training data and computation power. In this paper, we propose FLChain to build a decentralized, public auditable and healthy FL ecosystem with trust and incentive. FLChain replace traditional FL parameter server whose computation result must be consensual on-chain.
